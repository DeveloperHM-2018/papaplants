It is native to South Africa and is common as a houseplant worldwide. Pachira Aquatica also receives this nickname.\r\\n<h4><strong>Crassula ovata Description</strong></h4>\r\\nThe jade plant is an evergreen with thick branches. It has thick, shiny, smooth, leaves that grow in opposing pairs along the branches. Leaves are rich jade green, although some may appear to be more of a yellow-green. Some varieties may develop a red tinge on the edges of leaves when exposed to high levels of sunlight. New stem growth is the same color and texture as the leaves but becomes brown and woody with age. Under the right conditions, they may produce small white or pink star-like flowers in early spring.\r\\n<h4><strong>Crassula ovata Cultivation</strong></h4>\r\\nAs a succulent, Crassula ovata requires little water in the summer, and even less in the winter. The jade plant is a little susceptible to overwatering. C. ovata is famous for garnishing a red tinge around its leaves when grown with bright sunlight. In more extreme cases, the green color of the plant is lost and can be replaced by yellow. This is caused by the jade plant making pigments such as carotenoids to protect from harsh sunlight and ultraviolet rays. The jade plant also does best in rich, well-draining soil. The plant also flowers in the wintertime, particularly during a cooler, darker, dry spell. C. ovata is sometimes attacked by mealybugs, a common nuisance of succulents.\r\\n<h4><strong>Crassula ovata Propagation</strong></h4>\r\\nJade plants propagate readily from both with success rates higher with cuttings. In the wild, propagation is the jade plant\'s main method of reproduction. Branches regularly fall off wild jade plants and these branches may root and form new plants.\r\\n\r\\nWhile propagation methods may vary, most will follow similar steps. Environmental factors such as temperature and humidity affect the speed at which the roots and new plants develop. Foliage usually appears soon after new roots have formed.\r\\n<h4><strong>Crassula ovata Bonsai</strong></h4>\r\\nThe jade plant is well known for its bonsai capabilities since it forms a bonsai very easily when pruning is done correctly. Many who learn bonsai begin with a jade plant since they are durable, easy to put through the bonsai process, and attractive.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 1, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '220', '299', 'crassulaovata, good luck plant, Trishula plant', '', '', '', '', '', 'crassula-ovata-jade-plant', ''),

They are mostly vines, with some being shrubs, and a few species being herbaceous. For information about the fruit of the passiflora plant, see passionfruit. The monotypic genus Hollrungia seems to be inseparable from Passiflora, but further study is needed.\r\\n<h4><strong>Ecology</strong></h4>\r\\nThe passion flowers have a unique structure, which in most cases requires a large bee to effectively pollinate. In the American tropics, wooden beams are mounted very near passionfruit plantings to encourage carpenter bees to nest. The size and structure of flowers of other Passiflora species is optimized for pollination by hummingbirds (especially hermits like Phaethornis), bumble bees, wasps or bats, while yet others are self-pollinating. The Sword-billed Hummingbird (Ensifera) with its immensely elongated bill has co-evolved with certain passion flowers, such as P. mixta.\r\\n\r\\nYellow Passion Flower (P. lutea) pollen is apparently the only pollen eaten by the unusual bee Anthemurgus passiflora. However, these bees simply collect the pollen but do not pollinate the flowers.\r\\n\r\\nThe leaves are used as food plants by the larva of a number of Lepidoptera. To prevent the butterflies from laying too many eggs on any single plant, some passion flowers bear small colored nubs which resemble the butterflies\' eggs and seem to fool them into believing that more eggs have already been deposited on a plant than actually is the case. Also, many Passiflora species produce sweet nutrient-rich liquid from glands on their leaf stems. These fluids attract ants which will kill and eat many pests that they happen to find feeding on the passion flowers.\r\\n<h4><strong>Medicinal</strong></h4>\r\\nPassiflora incarnata (maypop) leaves and roots have a long history of use among Native Americans in North America and were adapted by the European colonists. The fresh or dried leaves of maypop are used to make a tea that is used for insomnia, hysteria, and epilepsy, and is also valued for its analgesic properties. P. edulis (passion fruit) and a few other species are used in Central and South America for similar purposes. Once dried, the leaves can also be smoked.\r\\n\r\\nThe medical utility of only a few species of Passiflora has been scientifically studied. In initial study in 2001 for treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, maypop extract performed as well as oxazepam but with fewer short-term side effects. It was recommended to follow up with long-term studies to confirm these results.\r\\n\r\\nA study performed on mice, it was shown that Passiflora alata has a genotoxic effect on cells, and further research was recommended before this one species is considered safe for human consumption.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '199', 'Krishna Kamal, passion flower', '', '', '', '', '', 'passiflora-incarnata-plant-passion-flower-krishnakamal-passiflora-blue', ''),

There are hundreds of species, most of them tropical and evergreen, although some are deciduous. Many varieties are natural dwarfs. Ficus is one of the most popular trees for indoor Bonsai. It is an excellent tree for beginners and pros alike. Virtually carefree; they tolerate the low light and humidity of a heated or air-conditioned house. The ?banyan? style roots are commonly trained in a root-over-rock style.\r\\n<h4><strong>Location</strong></h4>\r\\nFicus can be grown indoors, close to a sunny window, or outdoors year-round in warmer climates. Direct morning sunlight is preferable; direct afternoon sun can sometimes burn the delicate leaves. Ficus trees don?t like cold drafts and, are not fond of sudden changes. Make moves gradually. Use a humidity tray under your bonsai to keep humidity levels up. Ficus that live outdoors should be protected from frost and/or freezing temperatures.\r\\n<h4><strong>Watering</strong></h4>\r\\nBonsai trees live in small pots and their world dries out much quicker than plants in the ground or in bigger pots, so close attention should be paid to watering. Check and water your bonsai every day. Striking a balance between not enough water and too much water can be a bit tricky but is very important. Water thoroughly and deeply when it needs water and let it catch its breath before watering again. An old bonsai watering trick is to place the entire pot in a sink of water an inch or two deep and let the water absorb from the holes in the bottom of the pot. Another favorite way to know if it needs watering is to lift it. You can get a sense for whether it needs watering by its weight.\r\\n\r\\nAn inexpensive moisture meter takes the guesswork out of watering. Water slowly so it absorbs into the dirt, otherwise, the water will run all over your table. Mist occasionally with a spray bottle too. It helps take the burden off of the roots especially when it?s very hot and dry out. We pot our bonsai trees specifically to drain well, so it?s almost impossible to overwater.\r\\n<h4><strong>Misting</strong></h4>\r\\nLeaves want humidity to keep them green and healthy. Any time your tree is inside, the air is very dry. Mist often during the day. Avoid putting your Bonsai near a draft or vent, which dries out the foliage. A humidity tray is a great way to increase humidity. These shallow trays filled with small stones have water in the bottom of the tray. Make sure the water does not reach the bottom of the Bonsai pot. As the water evaporates, it creates a moister environment.\r\\n<h4><strong>Fertilizing</strong></h4>\r\\nFertilizing a bonsai is essential to its health because the nutrients in the soil leave very quickly with the water. When new growth appears in the spring it?s time to start feeding your bonsai. Use an organic liquid fertilizer or a chemical fertilizer diluted to one-half strength. Fertilize every two weeks during the growing season and once a month in the winter. Ficus responds quickly and enthusiastically to fertilizing; do not skip it.\r\\n<h4><strong>Pruning</strong></h4>\r\\nFicus is a very fast grower. Prune back to 2-4 leaves after 6-10 leaves have grown. Ideally, do the heavy pruning in the spring but it can be done year-round. Keep the new growth trimmed back during the growing season. When you trim a Ficus, it will bleed a milky, white sap?actually latex. This latex dries quickly and makes a great sealant. When pruning back smaller branches leave a short stub that will dry out over the following days, then just take the dry branch off and it will heal with less of a scar.\r\\n<h4><strong>Wiring</strong></h4>\r\\nGood wiring techniques are used to train Bonsai trees into different shapes and styles. Use the thinnest training wire that will hold the branch in the desired position. DO NOT WIRE A BONSAI JUST AFTER REPOTTING. Wind the training wire in the direction the branch is bent in order to keep the wire from loosening. Wrapping the wire too tightly will cause scarring. Wrap just tight enough to get the job done. Begin at the base of the Bonsai tree and slowly wrap the wire around the trunk to anchor. Continue along the branch you wish to train. Repeat the process as needed. After about 6 weeks, the branch should be able to maintain the shape on it?s own, and the wire can be removed. Cut the wire carefully from the branch. DO NOT UNWIND WIRES. This could cause the branch to break.\r\\n<h3><strong>Insects and Diseases:</strong></h3>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>The scale is the most common insect that attacks a Ficus. Scale is usually identified by brown or black bumps on the branches. These bumps contain insects under a protective waxy shell. A very sticky secretion that discolours the branches may also be present.</li>\r\\n  <li>Mites also like to infest the Ficus. Identified by small moving pinpoints of red or brown on branch tips, severe infestations leave ?spider webs? on branch tips and yellow leaves all over the tree.</li>\r\\n  <li>Mealybugs look like whitish cottony areas at the leaf base with some infestations appearing mainly on the roots. These infestations can only be seen during repotting.</li>\r\\n  <li>Ficus will not tolerate insecticides containing Malathion. Dormant oil is well tolerated on most Figs, at one tablespoon/gallon. Root mealies cannot be treated effectively with oil. This particular infestation will require systemic poisoning.</li>\r\\n  <li>If your Ficus starts dropping leaves for no apparent reason, the most frequent cause is excessive wetness or dryness. However, a sudden draft of cold air or sudden exposure to bright sunlight may produce the same results. Do nothing. Keep Ficus warm and let the soil dry out before watering again and, the plant will re-leaf in 3-4 weeks time.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n</div>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '450', 'chinese Banyan tree, Dwarf Ficus Plant, ficus, ficus bonsai, Ficus microcarpa bonsai Plant, fig', '', '', '', '', '', 'ficus-microcarpa-plant', ''),

Tulsi is grown as an annual herb in temperate climates. The tulsi plant is pleasing to the eye, with an upright, open and branching form. The fragrance of the leaves is also quite attractive-spicy and complex, often resembling clove. The taste is excellent, especially when the dried leaves are brewed into tea. The flowers of purple or blue occur on multiple upright racemes.\r\\n<h3><strong>Types of Tulsi</strong></h3>\r\\n<strong>Four main forms are generally recognized</strong>\r\\n\r\\nKrishna Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum) with leaves of purple, Rama Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum) with stems of purple,\r\\nKapoor Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum) with leaves of green, and Vana Tulsi (Ocimum gratissimum), which is unmodified from its wild form. Tulsi exhibits great variation across its range and among the several domesticated cultivars. Variations in soil type and rainfall may also equate to a difference in the size and form of the plants as well as their medicinal strength and efficacy.\r\\n<h4><strong>Cultivation</strong></h4>\r\\nTulsi seed is easy to germinate and grow. Sow the small Tulsi seeds in early spring indoors or in the greenhouse for an early start, or sow Tulsi seed directly in the spring or summer garden. Sow Tulsi seeds just under the surface of the soil and press in firmly. Keep Tulsi seed watered and warm until germination, which occurs within 2 to 3 weeks (faster for Kapoor). Tulsi prefers full sun, rich soil, and plenty of water. Thin or transplant to 1 to 2 feet apart. Tulsi does well in pots or window boxes and is traditionally grown for good luck near the front door of the house.\r\\n<h4><strong>Climatic conditions for growth</strong></h4>\r\\nTulsi seed is easy to germinate and grow.

In the winter you should only water when you see that the pseudobulbs are beginning to shrivel because this is an indicator that you are not giving the plant enough water.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Dendrobium Light Requirements</strong>\r\\nDen-Nobile orchids, along with it?s hybrids, grow best with high light intensity.

The number of fern species is about 9,000, but estimates have ranged to as high as 15,000, the number varying because certain groups are as yet poorly studied and because new species are still being found in unexplored tropical areas.\r\\n\r\\nThe ferns constitute an ancient division of vascular plants, some of them as old as the Carboniferous Period (beginning about 359 million years ago) and perhaps older. Their type of life cycle, dependent upon spores for dispersal, long preceded the seed-plant life cycle.\r\\n<h4><strong>Where do they grow?</strong></h4>\r\\nFerns are typically found in moist, forested areas because they require lots of water. Ferns are abundant in all damp situations in New Zealand forests, forming the undergrowth beneath a dense canopy of evergreen trees. They are also found growing on tree trunks and branches and along stream banks. Some hardy species have adapted to other drier habitats such as coastal, alpine, urban and even desert locations.\r\\n\r\\nTree ferns are some of the most distinctive features of our forests. They occur in all forest types and are most plentiful in cut-over and degraded forests, where light levels are relatively high. They also appear in older plantations of exotic trees that are relatively open.\r\\n<h4><strong>Fern facts</strong></h4>\r\\nThe leaves of ferns are called fronds and when they are young they are tightly coiled into a tight spiral. This shape, called a ?koru? in M?ori, is a popular motif in many New Zealand designs.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Ferns can be categorized based on their growth forms such as tufted, creeping, climbing, perching and tree ferns.</strong>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>One notable New Zealand fern is bracken (r?rahu), which grows in open, disturbed areas and was a staple of the early M?ori diet in places too cold for the k?mara to grow. The roots were gathered in spring or early summer and left to dry before they were cooked and eaten.</li>\r\\n  <li>The silver fern or ponga is a national symbol and is named for the silvery underside of its fronds.</li>\r\\n  <li>The mamaku is New Zealand?s tallest tree fern, growing up to 20 meters high.</li>\r\\n  <li>Wheki is another type of tree fern that can be distinguished by its hairy koru and ?skirt? of dead, brown fronds hanging from under the crown. It often forms groves by means of spreading underground rhizomes, which give rise to several stems.</li>\r\\n  <li>Most ferns reproduce sexually (see below), but some ferns also have efficient means of vegetative reproduction, such as the underground stems of bracken and the tiny bulblets that grow on the surface of fronds of the hen-and-chicken fern.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n</div>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '249', '349', 'Boston Fern, fern', '', '', '', '', '', 'golden-boston-fern', ''),

That said, however, some people have more luck with Maranta species than with the closely related Calathea, which also feature beautiful leaves but can be a bit more temperamental. In terms of display, Maranta is all fairly low-growing plants, with none reaching over about 8 inches tall, making them excellent for grouped displays of low plants on a windowsill.\r\\n<h3><strong>Growing Conditions</strong></h3>\r\\n<h4><strong>Light</strong></h4>\r\\nMaranta dislikes direct sunlight. If exposed to direct light, their leaves will fade in color intensity and often develop blotches or patches. In the winter, when the plants go into dormancy (and sometimes die back completely), give them bright light to maintain growth.\r\\n<h4><strong>Water</strong></h4>\r\\nDuring the growth season, water frequently and never allows potting soil to dry out. They are very susceptible to drought. However, to avoid fungal problems, try not to get water directly on the leaves or let it sit.\r\\n<h4><strong>Soil</strong></h4>\r\\nA rich, peat-based potting soil with excellent drainage is beneficial.\r\\n<h4><strong>Fertilizer</strong></h4>\r\\nFeed with a weak liquid fertilizer throughout the growing season. Cut fertilizer back to once a month or so in the winter.\r\\n<h4><strong>Propagation</strong></h4>\r\\nSome Maranta species can be propagated by leaf cuttings or rhizome division. The most common (and easiest) way to propagate Maranta is by division at repotting. When repotting, simply divide the plant into half and pot up each half in a fresh pot. Keep new divisions very warm and moist during the first few weeks until new growth emerges.\r\\n<h4><strong>Repotting</strong></h4>\r\\nMaranta are not necessarily fast-growing plants and even healthy specimens likely only need to be repotted every other year. During repotting, gently remove the plant from its old container, shake roots clean, and place into new container with fresh potting soil. Divide the plant during repotting to increase your stock. Repot in the spring, before the growing season starts.\r\\n<h4><strong>Varieties</strong></h4>\r\\nThere are many varieties of Maranta, but the most popular by far is the tricolor variation that pops up in garden centers. Alternatively, the Maranta and Calathea plants are so closely associated with one another that it\'s not uncommon to see labeling errors.\r\\n<h4><strong>Grower\'s Tips</strong></h4>\r\\nA well-grown Maranta should have full, six-inch-long leaves rising from a short center stem and draping down. They are strikingly beautiful plants. They thrive best with provided with greenhouse-like conditions: warm, moist, gentle airflow, and plenty of fertilizer. Plants that are kept too cool or too dry are likely to lose their leaves or suffer from fungal infections that will cause the plant to die from root rot or collapse. Plants that are exposed to too much sun are likely to become washed out and develop brown blotches on their leaves.\r\\n\r\\nThese plants, with their fleshy and thick leaves, are prime targets for pests (in my experience) and frequently seem to have problems with mealybugs, aphids, and mites. Signs of infestation include tiny webs on plants, clumps of white \"powdery\" residue, or visible insects on the plant. Treat infestations as soon as possible to prevent them from spreading to the rest of your collection. As always, start with the least toxic treatment option first, only progressing to more serious chemicals if your initial efforts fail.\r\\n\r\\n</div>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '349', 'Black Marantha, Calathea Ornata, Marantha', '', '', '', '', '', 'black-marantha-ornata-plant-maranta-majestica-calathea-ornata', ''),

There are hundreds of species, most of them tropical and evergreen, although some are deciduous. Many varieties are natural dwarfs. Ficus is one of the most popular trees for indoor Bonsai. It is an excellent tree for beginners and pros alike. Virtually care free; they tolerate low light and humidity of a heated or air-conditioned house. The ?banyan? style roots are commonly trained in a root-over-rock style.\r\\n<h3><strong>Location:</strong></h3>\r\\nFicus can be grown indoors, close to a sunny window, or outdoors year-round in warmer climates. Direct morning sunlight is preferable; direct afternoon sun can sometimes burn the delicate leaves. Ficus trees don?t like cold drafts and, are not fond of sudden changes. Make moves gradually. Use a humidity tray under your bonsai to keep humidity levels up. Ficus that live outdoors should be protected from frost and/or freezing temperatures.\r\\n<h3><strong>Watering:</strong></h3>\r\\nBonsai trees live in small pots and their world dries out much quicker than plants in the ground or in bigger pots, so close attention should be paid to watering. Check and water your bonsai every day. Striking a balance between not enough water and too much water can be a bit tricky but is very important. Water thoroughly and deeply when it needs water and let it catch its breath before watering again. An old bonsai watering trick is to place the entire pot in a sink of water an inch or two deep and let the water absorb from the holes in the bottom of the pot. Another favorite way to know if it needs watering is to lift it. You can get a sense of whether it needs watering by its weight.\r\\n\r\\nAn inexpensive moisture meter takes the guesswork out of watering. Water slowly so it absorbs into the dirt, otherwise, the water will run all over your table. Mist occasionally with a spray bottle too. It helps take the burden off of the roots especially when it?s very hot and dry out. We pot our bonsai trees specifically to drain well, so it?s almost impossible to overwater.\r\\n<h3><strong>Misting:</strong></h3>\r\\nLeaves want humidity to keep them green and healthy. Any time your tree is inside, the air is very dry. Mist often during the day. Avoid putting your Bonsai near a draft or vent, which dries out the foliage. A humidity tray is a great way to increase humidity. These shallow trays filled with small stones have water in the bottom of the tray. Make sure the water does not reach the bottom of the Bonsai pot. As the water evaporates, it creates a moister environment.\r\\n<h3><strong>Fertilizing:</strong></h3>\r\\nFertilizing a bonsai is essential to its health because the nutrients in the soil leave very quickly with the water. When new growth appears in the spring it?s time to start feeding your bonsai. Use an organic liquid fertilizer or a chemical fertilizer diluted to one-half strength. Fertilize every two weeks during the growing season and once a month in the winter. Ficus responds quickly and enthusiastically to fertilizing; do not skip it.\r\\n<h3><strong>Pruning:</strong></h3>\r\\nFicus is a very fast grower. Prune back to 2-4 leaves after 6-10 leaves have grown. Ideally, do the heavy pruning in the spring but it can be done year-round. Keep the new growth trimmed back during the growing season. When you trim a Ficus, it will bleed a milky, white sap?actually latex. This latex dries quickly and makes a great sealant. When pruning back smaller branches leave a short stub which will dry out over the following days, then just take the dry branch off and it will heal with less of a scar.\r\\n<h3><strong>Wiring:</strong></h3>\r\\nGood wiring techniques are used to train Bonsai trees into different shapes and styles. Use the thinnest training wire that will hold the branch in the desired position. DO NOT WIRE A BONSAI JUST AFTER REPOTTING. Wind the training wire in the direction the branch is bent in order to keep the wire from loosening. Wrapping the wire too tightly will cause scarring. Wrap just tight enough to get the job done. Begin at the base of the Bonsai tree and slowly wrap the wire around the trunk to anchor. Continue along the branch you wish to train. Repeat the process as needed. After about 6 weeks, the branch should be able to maintain the shape on it?s own, and the wire can be removed. Cut the wire carefully from the branch. DO NOT UNWIND WIRES. This could cause the branch to break.\r\\n<h3><strong>Insects and Diseases:</strong></h3>\r\\nThe scale is the most common insect that attacks a Ficus. Scale is usually identified by brown or black bumps on the branches. These bumps contain insects under a protective waxy shell. A very sticky secretion that discolours the branches may also be present.\r\\nMites also like to infest the Ficus. Identified by small moving pinpoints of red or brown on branch tips, severe infestations leave ?spider webs? on branch tips and yellow leaves all over the tree.\r\\nMealybugs look like whitish cottony areas at the leaf base with some infestations appearing mainly on the roots. These infestations can only be seen during repotting.\r\\n\r\\nFicus will not tolerate insecticides containing Malathion. Dormant oil is well tolerated on most Figs, at one tablespoon/gallon. Root mealies cannot be treated effectively with oil. This particular infestation will require systemic poisoning.\r\\n\r\\nIf your Ficus starts dropping leaves for no apparent reason, the most frequent cause is excessive wetness or dryness. However, a sudden draft of cold air or sudden exposure to bright sunlight may produce the same results. Do nothing. Keep Ficus warm and let the soil dry out before watering again and, the plant will re-leaf in 3-4 weeks time.\r\\n\r\\n<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/bonsaiginsengficus/health-benefits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Five Best Reasons To Bring A Bonsai Tree Into Your Life</a>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '199', 'chinese Banyan tree, Dwarf Ficus Plant, ficus, ficus bonsai, Ficus microcarpa bonsai Plant, fig', '', '', '', '', '', 'ficus-microcarpa-bonsai-ginseng', ''),

The striping gives it the common name of the snake plant.\r\\n\r\\nSansevieria is only new to the United States and people in the United Kingdom and Australia have been growing them for some time. Sometimes called the African spear plant, the Sansevieria cylindrica has all the ease and durability of the popular snake plant and the appeal of lucky bamboo. The plant consists of stout, cylindrical spears that spring from the sandy soil. They can be braided or left in their natural fan shape. Best of all, they can be almost ignored and the plant will thrive.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Growing Conditions</strong>\r\\n<strong>Light:</strong>?Bright, filtered light, but highly tolerant.\r\\n<strong>Water:</strong>?Can survive long periods of drought. Water monthly or less in winter, weekly or every other week in summer.\r\\n<strong>Temperature:</strong>?Above 50?F, but can survive cold spells.\r\\n<strong>Soil:?</strong>Use a fast-draining cactus mix.\r\\n<strong>Fertilizer:</strong> Feed during the growing season. Do not feed during winter.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Propagation</strong>\r\\nAfrican spears can be divided when several spears are present, but it?s usually best to buy a new plant.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Repotting</strong>\r\\nRepot annually or every other year in the spring. They will survive being rootbound.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Varieties</strong>\r\\nThe basic species is Sansevieria cylindrica, although there are a few varieties available, and some growers have experimented with braiding or shaping the basic plant. Spear-like Sansevieria may be lightly banded or solid coloured, ranging in size from 12 inches to 24 inches. All species, however, are equally hardy.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Grower?s Tips</strong>\r\\nThese are almost foolproof plants. They can survive long periods of drought, haphazard feeding, and being root-bound. Similarly, they can be acclimated to deep shade or bright light. Truly, they thrive on neglect. One exception to this rule: their pots must be well-drained. Like succulents, the roots cannot be allowed to sit in water or they will begin to rot. These make great desktop plants for people who want something besides lucky bamboo. They bear small flower spikes arising from the base of the spears.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '180', 'Dwarf, Green plant, sansevieria, Snake Plant', '', '', '', '', '', 'dwarf-snake-plant-with-colored-finished-pot', ''),

It is relatively easy to grow, particularly for those in tropical or subtropical locations where maintenance is minimal. It can also be container-grown for those in frost-prone regions.\r\\n<h3><strong>Fruit</strong></h3>\r\\nDragon fruits are in no hurry to ripen, with maturing times ranging from 45 to 150 days. The fruits have scales on their outer shells, and the flesh is custardlike and pleasant. Small black seeds dot the inside of the flesh. Selenicereus fruits are yellow with white flesh. Hylocereus is generally a hot pink or red color with white or pink flesh. Dragon fruits can grow very large, weighing up to 2 pounds at full maturity. Fruits with pink flesh tend to be sweeter than those with white flesh, regardless of the variety.\r\\n<h3><strong>Climate</strong></h3>\r\\nLike most cactus species, the dragon fruit prefers very warm conditions and cannot survive below 28 degrees Fahrenheit. It performs well in USDA zones 10 and 11 but may need to be protected from frost in zone 9. While they enjoy full sun, they can get sunburned and need occasional shade, making it best to plant them where they will be shaded by other structures or plants for a small portion of the day. They enjoy well-drained soil high in organic materials and have an affinity for soil containing saline.\r\\n<h3>Fertilizer</h3>\r\\nTo ensure that the dragon fruit is growing properly, give it some fertilizer every month during the active growing season. During the cold winter months, you will want to stop feeding your plant for a few months.\r\\n<h3><strong>Soil Requirements?</strong></h3>\r\\nThis plant is able to grow in any soil that is well-draining, but it prefers to grow in soil that is slightly acidic with a pH level that is between six and seven. Sandy soil is the best option for this plant; if it is not available, just ensure that it is a well-draining soil.\r\\n\r\\n</div>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 1, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '300', '425', 'dragon fruit plant, pitahaya, pitaya', '', '', '', '', '', 'dragon-fruit-plant-pitayapitahaya-nursery-nisarga', ''),

The most important factors to consider when growing jade houseplants is water, light, temperature, and fertilizer.\r\\n<h4>Watering a Jade Plant</h4>\r\\nOne of the most important things, when you care for jade plants, is to make sure that they are watered properly. Never let a jade plant dry out completely. But also, do not water a jade plant too often, as this can cause root rot. Don?t water your jade plant on a schedule. Rather, water your jade plant when the top of the soil is just dry to the touch.\r\\n\r\\nIf your jade plant is losing leaves or has leaf spots, this is most commonly caused by too little water.\r\\n<h4>Sunlight Requirements of a Jade Plant</h4>\r\\nAnother important aspect of the care and maintenance of jade plants is how much sun they receive. They need full sun in order to grow properly. If they do not have full sun, they may become stunted and leggy.\r\\n<h4>Proper Temperature for Jade Plants</h4>\r\\nJade plant care instructions say that jade plants do best in day time temperatures of 65-75 degrees F. during the day and 50?55 degrees F. at night. That being said, if they get lots of sunlight, they will do fine in temperatures that are higher than this.\r\\n<h4>Fertilizing Your Jade Plant</h4>\r\\nFor proper jade plant care, you need to fertilize your jade plant about once every six months. Use a balanced water-soluble fertilizer. An important thing to keep in mind is that you should water your jade plant in a regular way and then water it with the fertilizer water. Never fertilize your jade plant when the soil is dry, as this will damage the roots.\r\\n\r\\nAs you can see, how to care for a jade plant is pretty simple. With a little TLC and proper jade plant care, your pretty jade plant might one day become a pretty jade tree\r\\n\r\\nHere\'s Jade Plant <a href=\"https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/houseplants/jade-plant/jade-plant-care.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">caring Instruction</a>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '199', '249', 'Crassula ovata, Home Decorative, Indoor plants, Jade Plant, lucky plant', '', '', '', '', '', 'jade-plant-miniature-crassula-ovata', ''),

However, in areas in which it does not have access to water in the dry season or during times of drought it sheds its leaves.\r\\n\r\\nThe Gulmohar grows well in the tropical and subtropical areas of the world. It prefers the sun and does not like shade and doesn\'t grow well in shaded areas. It is native to Madagascar but is under threat in the wild there because of habitat destruction.\r\\n\r\\nThe tree commonly bears red, crimson, orange and to a lesser extent the rarer yellow-colored flowers.\r\\n\r\\nThe Gulmohur tree competes with other nearby vegetation and therefore the ground under its canopy remains bare. The tree starts bearing flowers after 4 to 5 but there are instances of trees flowering after 12 years or more.\r\\n\r\\nDelonix regia can tolerate salty conditions and hence can also be grown in coastal areas.\r\\n<h2>Uses of a Gulmohar plant</h2>\r\\nThe plant has several medicinal uses like it is used to treat constipation, inflammations, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327624197_ANTI-DIABETIC_POTENTIAL_OF_DELONIX_REGIA\">diabetes</a>, arthritis, and hemiplegia. Thus it can be said that apart from being a treat to the eyes of an onlooker, the plant also has many medicinal uses which make Gulmohur stand out in the crowd. The wood is employed locally for agricultural implements; handles for carpentry tools, combs, etc. The principle uses it as fuel, the calorific value of wood is 4600 kcal/kg.

Flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colors ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwest Africa. Species, cultivars, and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.

Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of a wide range of garden roses.\r\\n<h3>Rose Plant Care Tips</h3>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>The very first aspect that should come to your mind at the time of planting a rose shrub is the kind of plant that must be planted in the soil. You can get different types of saplings like roses that are in the form of dormant bare root plants or as roses potted in the soil. If you are just starting with the task of rose planting you must start with container roses. It is very easy to plant them in the soil.</li>\r\\n  <li>You must bear in mind the fact that roses are a type of highly fragrant flowers which come in a large number of varieties. From climbing roses to the ground covers you can get roses in different colors, fragrances, and sizes. However, to begin with, you must not be too ambitious in your plans. If you think that growing a large variety of roses at a single time is a good idea then you must think again. Many of them are not compatible and can feed into each other\'s health, which can ruin your entire garden. Hence do not try to grow too many varieties at the same time.</li>\r\\n  <li>Roses grow best in a certain type of climate and environment. It is imperative that the rose bushes mush get sunlight for a continuous period of eight hours. Even then too harsh a sun can be bad for the flowers. In too severe winters try to plant your rose bushes so that they can be kept guarded against the winter\'s frosty hails. Additionally, try to plant roses in organically rich soil. It is best to plant roses in a sandy soil that is well-drained.</li>\r\\n  <li>The timing of planning the bushes is also very important. Spring is the best period when you can plant roses. The first part of the fall is also a good time to plant roses. This is when the plant gets ample time to strike its roots deep before the arrival of the winters.</li>\r\\n  <li>You must water the rose beds regularly so that the harvest can be kept well nourished.</li>\r\\n</ul>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '199', 'pink rose, Red Rose, Rose, white rose, yellow rose', '', '', '', '', '', 'red-rose-laal-gulab-plant', ''),

Since they also tolerate drought and damp conditions well, they are showcased throughout landscaped lawns and gardens all over the world. The flower spikes are colorful and full of texture, and the leaves of some bottlebrush varieties are ornamental as well. Since the average lifespan for bottlebrushes is twenty to forty years, they promise beauty and blooms for many years. Although the woody shrub is low maintenance, proper care can help to ensure it continues blooming to its fullest each year.\r\\n\r\\nBottlebrush plants (Callistemon spp.) get their name from the spikes of flowers that bloom at the ends of the stems, bearing a strong resemblance to a bottle brush. Grow them as shrubs or small trees that grow up to 15 feet. Most bottlebrush varieties bloom over a long summer season in shades of red or crimson. One exception is C. sieberi, which has light yellow flower spikes.\r\\n\r\\nBottlebrush plants need a very mild climate. If you live in an area cooler than the U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 8b through 11, grow bottlebrush in pots that you can move to a protected area for winter. Use a rich, peaty potting soil with a few handfuls of sand added to improve the drainage. If pruned hard every year, the plants will grow in pots as small as 6 to 8 inches in diameter. If you plan to let the shrub grow, you?ll need a large tub.\r\\n<h4>Planting and care</h4>\r\\nOutdoors, plant bottlebrush shrubs in a sunny location.

These trees form large forests characterized by wide open areas with sunlight spilling to the forest floor. Pines are sun-loving trees that do not grow well under shady conditions. Most of these trees live in the Northern Hemisphere, except for the Sumatran pine (Pinus merkussi) surviving south of the equator.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Evergreen</strong>\r\\nThese conifers are considered evergreen, which means that they keep their needles for at least two years. As the older needles fall, new ones are ready to grow in their place. Bristlecone pine trees (Pinus longaeva) keep their needles for at least 30 years.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Needles</strong>\r\\nPine trees produce long, narrow needles 1 to 11 inches long. For example, longleaf pine trees (Pinus palustris) grow needles 9 inches long. Pine needles range from blue to dark green and are bundled into groups of two, three or five needles. The needles connect near the point where they attach to the branch.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Identification</strong>\r\\nNeedles hold the key to breaking the pine tree types into smaller classifications. Needles bundled in groups of two belong to the lodgepole pine group (Pinus contorta). When needles are in groups of three, they originate from ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa), Jeffery pines (Pinus jefferyi) or knobcone pines (Pinus attenuate). Western white pines (Pinus monticola), sugar pines (Pinus lambertiana), limber pines (Pinus flexilis) and whitebark pines (Pinus albicaulis) grow needles in bunches of five.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Cones</strong>\r\\nLarge woody cones are a key element for pine trees. Both female and male cones appear on a tree. The female cones produce seeds, while the male cones drop pollen. The pollen is carried by gravity or wind to the female cones, fertilizing the seeds. Sugar pines produce cones 10 to 20 inches long.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Branches</strong>\r\\nMost pine trees produce lateral branches in large whorls running up a straight trunk, which make the tree easy to climb. The bark covering the trunk and branches flakes off with large scales. The pine tree releases a strong pine scent when disturbed or overheated.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Size</strong>\r\\nPine trees reach a range of mature sizes that depends on the species. The dwarf mugo pine (Pinus mugo pumilio) grows to a mature size of 4 feet tall, while slash pines (Pinus elliottii) reach 100 feet. White pines reach up to 150 feet tall, growing only 8 to 12 inches a year when planted in favourable environments.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Age</strong>\r\\nAs a group, pine trees are long-lived conifers. Most varieties live over a century when growing in favourable conditions. Bristlecone pine trees are known to live at least 4,800 years.\r\\n\r\\n</div>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '300', 'Pencil pine, pine tree', '', '', '', '', '', 'pencil-pine-cypress-cupressus-sempervirens-plant', ''),

You may wonder ?can you plant your Christmas tree after Christmas?? and the answer is yes, you can. Replanting a Christmas tree requires some planning, but if you are willing to plan, you can enjoy your lovely Christmas tree for years to come.\r\\n<h5><strong>How to Plant Your Christmas Tree</strong></h5>\r\\nBefore you even buy the Xmas tree you will be replanting, you may also want to consider digging the hole that you will be planting the Christmas tree in. Chances are the ground will be not yet frozen at that time and by the time Christmas is over the chances that the ground will be frozen will have increased. Having a hole ready will help the chances that your tree will survive.\r\\n\r\\nWhen you plan on planting a Xmas tree, you need to make sure to purchase a live Christmas tree that has been sold with the root ball still intact. Typically, the root ball will come covered by a piece of burlap. Once a tree is cut from the root ball, it can no longer be planted outside, so make sure that the trunk and the root ball of the Christmas tree remain undamaged.\r\\n\r\\nWhen you decide to replant a Xmas tree outside after the holidays, you also need to accept that you will not be able to enjoy the tree indoors as long as you would a cut tree. This is because indoor conditions can put a live Xmas tree at risk. Expect that your Xmas tree will only be able to be in the house for 1 to1 ? weeks. Any longer than this, as you reduce the chance that your Xmas tree will be able to adapt to conditions outside again.\r\\n\r\\nWhen planting a Xmas tree, start by keeping the tree outside in a cold and sheltered place. When you buy your Christmas tree, it has been harvested in the cold and has already gone into dormancy. You need to keep it in that dormant state to help it survive being replanted. Keeping it in a cold place outside until you are ready to bring it indoors will help with this.\r\\n\r\\nOnce you bring your live Xmas tree indoors, place it in a draft-free location away from heaters and vents. Wrap the root ball in plastic or wet sphagnum moss. The root ball must stay damp the entire time the tree is in the house. Some people suggest using ice cubes or daily watering to help keep the root ball moist.\r\\n\r\\nOnce Christmas is over, move the Christmas tree you intend to replant back outside. Place the tree back into the cold, sheltered area for a week or two so that the tree can re-enter dormancy if it has started to come out of dormancy while it was in the house.\r\\n\r\\nNow you are ready to replant your Xmas tree. Remove the burlap and any other coverings on the root ball. Place the Xmas tree in the hole and backfill the hole. Then cover the hole with several inches of mulch and water the tree. You do not need to fertilize at this time. Fertilize the tree in the spring.\r\\n<div class=\"cell\">\r\\n<h3 class=\"section-title\">Plant Care</h3>\r\\n</div>\r\\n<div class=\"cell medium-4\">\r\\n<div class=\"grid-x grid-padding-x grid-padding-y\">\r\\n<div class=\"cell small-3 medium-12 large-2\"><img class=\"section-image\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0150/6262/t/111/assets/pdp-plant-care-icon_half-sun.png?v=805128663179135805\" alt=\"Light Tip\" width=\"81\" height=\"76\"></div>\r\\n<div class=\"cell small-9 medium-12 large-10\">\r\\n<h4 class=\"plant-care-title\">LIGHT</h4>\r\\n<p class=\"section-content\">Thrives in bright to medium indirect light.</p>\r\\n\r\\n</div>\r\\n</div>\r\\n</div>\r\\n<div class=\"cell medium-4\">\r\\n<div class=\"grid-x grid-padding-x grid-padding-y\">\r\\n<div class=\"cell small-3 medium-12 large-2\"><img class=\"section-image\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0150/6262/t/111/assets/pdp-plant-care-icon_water-biweekly.png?v=17626310380393541439\" alt=\"Water Tip\" width=\"81\" height=\"80\"></div>\r\\n<div class=\"cell small-9 medium-12 large-10\">\r\\n<h4 class=\"plant-care-title\">WATER</h4>\r\\n<p class=\"section-content\">Water every 1-2 weeks, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings.

Do not fertilize the plant or add compost to the soil. Texas sage does not need rich soil to thrive and prefers dry but well-draining alkaline soil with infrequent watering.\r\\n\r\\n2. Stop watering the plant during winter. It is a water-conserving plant and only needs occasional watering. Give it regular irrigation to get it established, making sure there\'s enough time between waterings for the plant to dry out. Once it\'s established, water during dry spells.\r\\n\r\\nToo much water decreases the frequency of blooms, causes the foliage to flop and increases the chances of root rot.\r\\n\r\\n3. Prune Texas sage in early spring if you want to maintain a rounded shape and reduce dense foliage. Pruning also helps older plants that become straggly. Texas sage bushes regenerate at a fast rate. The plant is semi-deciduous and loses some foliage during the colder months.\r\\n\r\\n4. Plant Texas sage bushes if you have rocky, gravelly soil.

It is native to Central and South America and surrounding islands. As a houseplant, it is most well known for its green leaves with natural leaf holes. A cousin of the Monstera deliciosa, its leaves are slightly smaller and their holes more pronounced. This plant lives to climb as it grows and matures, and will benefit from a moss pole or trellis.\r\\n\r\\nThe plant produces long, brown aerial roots it uses in the wild to get a hold on the trees on which it grows in jungles, thus supporting its weak stem that is unable to support its own weight once the plant has more than two or three leaves.\r\\n\r\\nIn nature, Monstera grows by climbing on trees; providing it something to climb on is necessary inside so that the plant can support itself. In a wet enough atmosphere, the plant will readily attach itself to anything it finds; in a normal apartment atmosphere, however, it will not and will have to be manually fixed. Aerial roots that are not actively used by the plant to support itself may be cut.\r\\n<h6>Care for Monstera or swiss cheese</h6>\r\\n<strong>Light: </strong>Bright indirect light is the best for a good growing Monstera Adansonii.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Water:</strong>? Water once every week, Make sure that the soil never completely dries out and keep it slightly moist.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Soil: </strong>Monstera Adansonii grows in an Aroid mix consisting of orchid bark, perlite, peat moss, and charcoal. As Monstera Adansonii is an epiphyte, it needs extremely well-draining soil or it might develop.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Humidity:</strong> The humidity requirement of your <i>Monstera adansonii</i>?will be somewhat higher than other commonly used houseplants.

They make beautiful corner plants and large indoor \"trees\" for entryways and foyers.\r\\n\r\\nFicus is one of the most popular houseplants in the world. Known as the weeping fig, the F. Benjamina is native to India and Southeast Asia, where its an important fruit and landscape plant. One of the common complaints about F. Benjamina is its tendency to shed leaves easily: you move it, it drops leaves; the watering schedule changes, it drops leaves. It might help to know that part of this is because of the way these plants have evolved. F. Benjamina are native to the subtropics and tropics where there is a distinct wet and dry season. In their native environment, plants typically drop leaves at the beginning of the dry season, making them exquisitely sensitive to changes in moisture. In terms of indoor culture, they are not especially demanding, but dislike being moved and, as mentioned before, they are highly sensitive to changes in watering.\r\\n<div id=\"shopify-section-product-plant-care\" class=\"shopify-section\"><section class=\"product-plant-care\" data-section-id=\"product-plant-care\" data-section-type=\"product-plant-care\">\r\\n<div class=\"grid-x grid-padding-x grid-padding-y\">\r\\n<div class=\"cell\">\r\\n<h3 class=\"section-title\">Plant Care</h3>\r\\n</div>\r\\n<div class=\"cell medium-4\">\r\\n<div class=\"grid-x grid-padding-x grid-padding-y\">\r\\n<div class=\"cell small-3 medium-12 large-2\"><img class=\"section-image\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0150/6262/t/110/assets/pdp-plant-care-icon_full-sun.png?v=6595913712348405148\" alt=\"Light Tip\" width=\"68\" height=\"63\"></div>\r\\n<div class=\"cell small-9 medium-12 large-10\">\r\\n<h4 class=\"plant-care-title\">Light</h4>\r\\n<p class=\"section-content\">Thrives in bright medium to high indirect sunlight.

Several other species in the genus Withania are morphologically similar. It is used as a herb in Ayurvedic medicine.\r\\n\r\\nThis species is a short annual shrub growing 35 to 75 centimetres tall. Tomentose branches extend radially from a central stem. The flowers are small and green. The ripe fruit is orange-red.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Cultivation</strong>\r\\nWithania Somnifera is cultivated in many of the drier regions of India, such as Mandsaur District of Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Sindh, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. It is also found in Nepal.\r\\n<h5><strong>Pathology</strong></h5>\r\\nWithania Somnifera is prone to several pests and diseases. Leaf spot disease caused by Alternaria alternata is the most prevalent disease, which is most severe in the plains of Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh. Biodeterioration of its pharmaceutically active components during leaf spot disease has been reported. The Choanephora cucurbitarum causes a stem and leaf rot of Withania Somnifera. A treehopper, feeds on the apical portions of the stem, making them rough and woody in appearance and brown in colour. The apical leaves are shed and the plant gradually dies. The carmine-red spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) is the most prevalent pest of the plant in India.\r\\n<h5><strong>Medicinal Uses</strong></h5>\r\\nThe plant\'s long, brown, tuberous roots are used for medicinal purposes.\r\\n\r\\nIn Ayurveda, the berries and leaves are applied externally to tumours, tubercular glands, carbuncles, and ulcers. The roots are used to prepare the herbal remedy ashwagandha, which has been traditionally used to treat various symptoms and conditions.\r\\n\r\\nIn two published clinical trials of W. Somnifera, the side effects were not significantly different from those experienced by placebo-treated individuals. Ashwagandha exhibits greater clinical benefit than psychotherapy in mental health (anxiety level), concentration, fatigue, social functioning, vitality, and overall quality of life.\r\\n\r\\nMultiple studies have shown positive effects in reducing physiological and psychological stress as well as restoring and increasing energy levels. More than one study had findings showing a significant improvement in both cardiovascular and respiratory endurance.\r\\n\r\\n</div>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '199', 'Ashwagandha, Indian ginseng, poison gooseberry, winter cherry, Withania Somnifera', '', '', '', '', '', 'withania-somnifera-ashwagandha-plant', ''),

These trees form large forests characterized by wide open areas with sunlight spilling to the forest floor. Pines are sun-loving trees that do not grow well under shady conditions. Most of these trees live in the Northern Hemisphere, except for the Sumatran pine (Pinus merkussi) surviving south of the equator.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Evergreen</strong>\r\\nThese conifers are considered evergreen, which means that they keep their needles for at least two years. As the older needles fall, new ones are ready to grow in their place. Bristlecone pine trees (Pinus longaeva) keep their needles for at least 30 years.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Needles</strong>\r\\nPine trees produce long, narrow needles 1 to 11 inches long. For example, longleaf pine trees (Pinus palustris) grow needles 9 inches long. Pine needles range from blue to dark green and are bundled into groups of two, three or five needles. The needles connect near the point where they attach to the branch.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Identification</strong>\r\\nNeedles hold the key to breaking the pine tree types into smaller classifications. Needles bundled in groups of two belong to the lodgepole pine group (Pinus contorta). When needles are in groups of three, they originate from ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa), Jeffery pines (Pinus jefferyi) or knobcone pines (Pinus attenuate). Western white pines (Pinus monticola), sugar pines (Pinus lambertiana), limber pines (Pinus flexilis) and whitebark pines (Pinus albicaulis) grow needles in bunches of five.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Cones</strong>\r\\nLarge woody cones are a key element for pine trees. Both female and male cones appear on a tree. The female cones produce seeds, while the male cones drop pollen. The pollen is carried by gravity or wind to the female cones, fertilizing the seeds. Sugar pines produce cones 10 to 20 inches long.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Branches</strong>\r\\nMost pine trees produce lateral branches in large whorls running up a straight trunk, which make the tree easy to climb. The bark covering the trunk and branches flakes off with large scales. The pine tree releases a strong pine scent when disturbed or overheated.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Size</strong>\r\\nPine trees reach a range of mature sizes that depends on the species. The dwarf mugo pine (Pinus mugo pumilio) grows to a mature size of 4 feet tall, while slash pines (Pinus elliottii) reach 100 feet. White pines reach up to 150 feet tall, growing only 8 to 12 inches a year when planted in favourable environments.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Age</strong>\r\\nAs a group, pine trees are long-lived conifers. Most varieties live over a century when growing in favourable conditions. Bristlecone pine trees are known to live at least 4,800 years.\r\\n\r\\n</div>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '199', 'Pencil pine, pine tree', '', '', '', '', '', 'pencil-pine-cypress-cupressus-sempervirens-plant', ''),

Portulaca plants are native to Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. Portulaca flowers are easy to grow and enjoy. Let?s look at what is needed for portulaca care.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>How to Grow Portulaca Plants</strong>\r\\nPortulaca flowers tolerate many kinds of soil but prefer sandy, well-drained soil and love the full sunlight. These plants are excellent for high heat and drought tolerance and will seed and spread themselves very well. Some control methods may be needed to keep portulaca plants from becoming invasive to areas where they are not wanted. From personal experience in my garden areas, I can tell you that these wonderful plants do spread easily and very well. I planted some seeds in the gravel mulch at the end of one of my rose beds and the following summer had portulaca plants coming up in several other areas where I had not planted any such seeds.\r\\n\r\\nYou do not need to water often for proper portulaca care. The cylindrical foliage of the portulaca flower retains moisture very well, thus, regular watering is not needed. When they are watered, just a light watering will do, as their root zone is very shallow.\r\\n\r\\nWhen planting the portulaca seeds, it is not necessary to cover the seed at all and, if covered, only very lightly as they need the sun to sprout and grow. The seeds planted in the gravel mulch in my rose bed were scattered by hand over the gravel and the gravel lightly rocked back and forth with my hand to help the seed reach the soil below.\r\\n\r\\nPortulaca flowers are truly beautiful in various garden and landscape settings and have been used to beautify old structures and stone walkways, as they grow well in the old cracks in the structures where winds have deposited just enough soil to support them. Portulaca flowers are beautiful growing around the stones of a garden path with their mix of beautiful colors of pink, red, yellow, orange, deep lavender, cream, and white.\r\\n\r\\nThese wonderful plants will help attract butterflies to your gardens as well as acting as ?eye-catchers? for your gardens or landscapes. They may be planted in containers as well such as whiskey barrel planters and hanging baskets. The portulaca plants will grow out and over the edges of the containers, making a grand display of their cylindrical somewhat moss like foliage and truly strikingly vibrant colored blooms.\r\\n\r\\nOne word of caution though, the area around and underneath where the hanging baskets or other containers are located can easily be populated by more portulaca plants the next summer from the seeds spread by the plants the previous year. This, too, has been the case in my personal experience with this very hardy plant. While portulaca is an annual, they do indeed come back every year without any further help from me.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '199', '10 o\'clock, moss rose, Portulaca, Portulaca flowers', '', '', '', '', '', 'moss-rose-10-oclock-portulaca-multi-color-plant', '');

Flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colors ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwest Africa. Species, cultivars, and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant. Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of a wide range of garden roses.\r\\n<h3>Rose Plant Care Tips</h3>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>The very first aspect that should come to your mind at the time of planting a rose shrub is the kind of plant that must be planted in the soil. You can get different types of saplings like roses that are in the form of dormant bare root plants or as roses potted in the soil. If you are just starting with the task of rose planting you must start with container roses. It is very easy to plant them in the soil.</li>\r\\n  <li>You must bear in mind the fact that roses are a type of highly fragrant flowers which come in a large number of varieties. From climbing roses to the ground covers you can get roses in different colors, fragrances, and sizes. However, to begin with, you must not be too ambitious in your plans. If you think that growing a large variety of roses at a single time is a good idea then you must think again. Many of them are not compatible and can feed into each other?s health, which can ruin your entire garden. Hence do not try to grow too many varieties at the same time.</li>\r\\n  <li>Roses grow best in a certain type of climate and environment. It is imperative that the rose bushes mush get sunlight for a continuous period of eight hours. Even then too harsh a sun can be bad for the flowers. In too severe winters try to plant your rose bushes so that they can be kept guarded against the winter?s frosty hails. Additionally, try to plant roses in organically rich soil. It is best to plant roses in a sandy soil that is well-drained.</li>\r\\n  <li>The timing of planning the bushes is also very important. Spring is the best period when you can plant roses. The first part of the fall is also a good time to plant roses. This is when the plant gets ample time to strike its roots deep before the arrival of the winters.</li>\r\\n  <li>You must water the rose beds regularly so that the harvest can be kept well nourished.</li>\r\\n</ul>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '199', 'button gulab, Button rose, miniature rose, rosa indica, Rose', '', '', '', '', '', 'button-rose-miniature-rose-multi-color-plant', ''),

This <a href=\"https://nurserynisarga.in/product-category/succulent/\">succulent</a> creeping plant, typically used as a container plant or ground cover, only tolerates winter temperatures within the U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 10 and 11. The variegated variety is commonly known as red apple (Aptenia cordifolia ?Red Apple?), while the non-variegated type is called baby sun rose or heartleaf ice plant. It requires little care, and because it?s succulent, too much care may kill it.\r\\n\r\\n</div>\r\\n<div id=\"section-1\" class=\"section\">\r\\n<h4>Light and Temperature</h4>\r\\nAlthough non-variegated aptenia is hardy to the coldest winter temperatures of USDA zone 10 -- 30 degrees Fahrenheit -- when actively growing, it requires temperatures of at least 50 degrees. You\'ll get more flowers if you grow the plant in full sun, although it survives in partial shade. The hotter the garden, the more shade you can safely provide the baby sun rose.\r\\n\r\\n</div>\r\\n<div id=\"section-2\" class=\"section\">\r\\n<h4>Water and Fertilizer</h4>\r\\nKeep the soil dry if you want the baby sun rose to remain compact, watering only when the soil is completely dry at the plant?s roots. In wetter soils, the plant has a tendency to become aggressive and may overwhelm anything planted in the vicinity. The plant is considered invasive in California, so keep an eye on its spread. Baby sun rose requires no fertilizer and may develop soft growth that\'s susceptible to rot if subjected to excess nitrogen.\r\\n\r\\n</div>\r\\n<div id=\"section-3\" class=\"section\">\r\\n<h4>Diseases</h4>\r\\nBaby sun rose doesn?t tolerate wet roots, whether from ill-draining soil or overwatering. If the plant begins turning soft and mushy and has a bad odour, it may have developed root rot, typically caused by the fungal pathogen Pythium splendens. Symptoms begin at the bottom of the plant and move up. The only thing that can be done for the baby sun rose, in this case, is to cut out any rotted parts and cut back on watering.\r\\n\r\\n</div>\r\\n<div id=\"section-4\" class=\"section\">\r\\n<h4>Pruning</h4>\r\\nBaby sun rose can be pruned anytime, and it\'s a good idea to keep it trimmed. Sterilize your pruning shears before setting to work on the plant by soaking them for five minutes in a solution of 1 part household bleach to 3 parts water. Place the soaking shears out of the reach of the little ones. After removing them from the bleach solution, rinse them in clear water. Cut the plant immediately above leaf clusters. To control unruly aptenia, use the lawnmower.\r\\n\r\\n</div>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '199', '249', 'aptenia plant, baby sun rose, Heartleaf Ice, red aptenia, sun rose', '', '', '', '', '', 'aptenia-sun-rose-plant', ''),

Amla is an excellent source of vitamin c, hence it helps to boost immunity, metabolism and prevents viral and bacterial ailments, including cold and cough. It is the main ingredient in Chawanprash, an Ayurvedic concoction to boost the immune system.\r\\n\r\\nThe tree is small to medium in size, reaching 8 to 18 m in height, with a crooked trunk and spreading branches.\r\\n\r\\nRipening in autumn, the berries are harvested by hand after climbing to upper branches bearing the fruits. The taste of Indian gooseberry is sour, bitter and astringent, and it is quite fibrous. In India, it is common to eat gooseberries steeped in saltwater and turmeric to make the sour fruits palatable. It is also used to straighten hair.\r\\n<h5><strong>Religious significance</strong></h5>\r\\nThe tree is considered sacred by Hindus as the Vishnu is believed to dwell here. The tree is worshipped on Amalaki Ekadashi.\r\\n\r\\nIn other Hindu myths, Aamla is said to be originated from the drops of Amrit which spilt on earth accidentally, due to the fight of Gods and Demons after sheer Sagar Manthan. And hence also this religious belief makes claims that it almost cures every disease and is also good in extending the longevity of life.\r\\n<h5><strong>Soil and Climate</strong></h5>\r\\nLight, as well as medium-heavy soils except for purely sandy soil, is ideal for amla cultivation. The tree is well adapted to dry regions and can also be grown in moderate alkaline soils.\r\\n<h5><strong>Propagation</strong></h5>\r\\nAmla is generally propagated by shield budding. Budding is done on one-year-old seedlings with buds collected from superior varieties yielding big sized fruits. Older trees or poor yielders can be changed into superior types by top working.\r\\n<h5><strong>Planting</strong></h5>\r\\nThe pits of 1 m3 are to be dug during May-June at a distance of 4.5 m x 4.5 m spacing and should be left for 15-20 days exposed to sunlight. Each pit should be filled with surface soil mixed with 15 kg farmyard manure and 0.5 kg of phosphorus before planting the budded seedling.\r\\n<h5><strong>Irrigation</strong></h5>\r\\nYoung plants require watering during summer months at 15 days intervals till they are fully established. Watering of bearing plants is advised during the summer months at the bi-weekly interval.\r\\n<h5><strong>Harvesting</strong></h5>\r\\nAmla tree starts bearing after about 4-5 years of planting. The fruits are harvested during February when they become dull greenish-yellow from light green.

A small tree, the plumeria reaches heights of about 30 feet at maturity. Also known as frangipani, a plumeria is a warm-climate plant hardy to USDA Planting Zones 9 to 11. Although the plant won\'t tolerate freezing winter climates, it can be planted in a container and brought indoors when the weather turns cold. Plumeria grows profusely in Hawaii and is a popular flower choice for leis.\r\\n<h5>Care Tips</h5>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Select a dwarf plumeria plant with an even, bright colour and a sturdy, straight trunk. Look for evenly-spaced branches. Avoid plants with wilted leaves or poor colour</li>\r\\n  <li>Position the plumeria where the tree will be exposed to bright sunlight for at least 4 to 6 hours every day. Choose a planting location where the soil drains well and water doesn\'t puddle after a rainfall.</li>\r\\n  <li>Plant a plumeria in a sturdy container filled almost to the top with a good quality commercial cactus mix or all-purpose potting mix. Use a container at least 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 cm) in diameter. Be sure to use a container with a hole in the bottom to provide soil drainage, as a plumeria won\'t do well with wet feet.</li>\r\\n  <li>Water a plumeria deeply, then don\'t water it again until the soil is dry. Decrease watering when the weather cools in autumn and stop watering completely during the winter months. Resume normal watering when you can see new growth in spring.</li>\r\\n  <li>Feed a plumeria a high-nitrogen fertilizer with a ratio such as 32-6-2 every 2 to 3 weeks, beginning when new growth appears in spring.\r\\n<h5>What to Do?</h5>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Every plant has a different type of light, feed and water requirements.</li>\r\\n  <li>Most of the plants like moderate watering, let a couple of inches at the surface dry before watering again.</li>\r\\n  <li>Some plants require frequent feeding but most, once in a year, feed the plant at beginning of spring.</li>\r\\n  <li>Re-pot the plant every couple of years in a slightly bigger container.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n<h5>What Not to Do?</h5>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Please avoid frequent watering in winters, it will kill the plant.</li>\r\\n  <li>Avoid temperature shocks like taking it suddenly <a href=\"https://nurserynisarga.in/product-category/indoorplant/\">indoors</a> or <a href=\"https://nurserynisarga.in/product-category/outdoorplant/\">outdoors</a>.</li>\r\\n  <li>Avoid partial watering and use water sprayers to water equally in all directions.</li>\r\\n  <li>Do not repot plants in large containers, most of the plants like to be in groups.</li>\r\\n  <li>Do not over-fertilizing, quantity depends on soil mix ingredients but plants do need not more than a spoon.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n</li>\r\\n</ul>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '549', '699', 'Dwarf champa, plumeria, plumeria champa, Singapori champa', '', '', '', '', '', 'singapore-dwarf-champa-plumeria-pink-and-white-shade', ''),

They can be trained to cascade down from a hanging planter, or to grow up a totem as a vine.\r\\n\r\\nThe asparagus fern plant (Asparagus aethiopicus syn. Asparagus densiflorus) is normally found in a hanging basket, decorating the deck or patio in summer and helping to clean indoor air in winter. The asparagus fern plant is not really a fern at all, but a member of the Liliaceae family. When growing asparagus ferns outside, place them in part sun to shady location for best foliage growth. While the asparagus fern plant may sometimes flower, the tiny white flowers are small and not necessary for the beauty of growing asparagus fern.\r\\n<h5><strong>Information on Asparagus Care</strong></h5>\r\\nGrowing asparagus fern is easy. The frilly, feathery asparagus fern plant appears soft and fuzzy, but when taking care of asparagus ferns you may be surprised to find they have thorny spurs. This, however, is no reason not to grow asparagus ferns, simply wear gloves during asparagus fern care.\r\\n\r\\nAsparagus fern can provide small flowers and berries when it is happy in its location. Berries can be planted to propagate the asparagus fern plant. Medium green, cascading foliage that will quickly fill a container can be expected when growing asparagus fern.\r\\n\r\\nGrowing asparagus fern indoors takes a little more effort. Humidity is necessary and indoor areas are often dry because of winter heat. Mist the plant daily and provide a nearby pebble tray to keep the tiny leaves from turning brown and dropping. The fern may dry out to the point it appears dead; however, outdoor springtime temperatures generally revive them.\r\\n\r\\nKeep well watered in all situations and repot every few years. Care of asparagus ferns indoors involves misting the arching stems to provide humidity to the plant. When you grow asparagus ferns outside in summer, asparagus fern care involves watering, fertilizing to encourage growth and occasionally pruning out dead stems. Asparagus ferns prefer to be pot-bound, so yearly division is not needed or desirable.\r\\n\r\\nCombine this reliable specimen with summer blooms and foliage plants for an attractive container.

When you know how to care for hibiscus plants, you will be rewarded with many years of lovely flowers. Let?s look at some tips on how to care for hibiscus.\r\\n<h5><strong>Growing Plant in Containers</strong></h5>\r\\nMany people who are growing a hibiscus plant choose to do so in a container. This allows them to move the hibiscus plant to ideal locations, depending on the time of year. Hibiscus plants prefer a cosy fit when growing in a container. This means that they should be slightly root bound in the pot and when you do decide to re-pot, only give the hibiscus a little bit more room. Always make sure that your growing hibiscus plant has excellent drainage.\r\\n<h5><strong>Temperatures</strong></h5>\r\\nWhen you care for a hibiscus, you should remember that hibiscus <a href=\"https://nurserynisarga.in/product-category/flowering/\">flowering</a> best in temperatures between 60 F. ? 90 F. and cannot tolerate temps below? 32 F. In the summer, your hibiscus plant can go outside but once the weather starts to get near freezing, it is time for you to bring your hibiscus indoors.\r\\n<h5><strong>Planting Instructions</strong></h5>\r\\nPlant in spring, summer, or fall, spacing plants 3 to 6 feet apart. Dig a hole only as deep as the root ball and 2 to 3 times as wide. If your soil is in very poor condition, amend the soil you\'ve removed from the hole with a small amount of compost. Otherwise don\'t amend it at all. Carefully remove the plant from the container and set it in the hole. Fill the hole half full with soil, then water it well to settle the soil and eliminate air pockets. Let the water drain, then fill the remainder of the hole with soil and water thoroughly.\r\\n<h5><strong>Plant Care</strong></h5>\r\\nHibiscus require at least 1 inch of rain (or equivalent watering) each week. They like to be constantly moist, but not wet. Feed twice a month during the growing season and prune as necessary to control plant size and cut back errant branches. Cut branches back to just above a side shoot. Hibiscus are sensitive to cold and should be protected when temperatures dip into the 30s; container-grown plants should be brought indoors. Check plants periodically for pests such as aphids, whiteflies, and mealybugs. Use a horticultural oil or insecticidal soap to control these pests.\r\\n<h5><strong>Watering</strong></h5>\r\\nWhen your plant is in their blooming stage, they require large amounts of water. Your plant will need daily watering in warm weather. But once the weather cools, your plant needs far less water, and too much water can kill it. In the winter, water only when the soil is dry to the touch.\r\\n<h5><strong>Fertilizing</strong></h5>\r\\nA growing plant needs lots of nutrients in order to bloom well. In the summer, use a high potassium fertilizer. You can either use a diluted liquid fertilizer once a week, a slow-release fertilizer once a month or you can add a high potassium compost to the soil. In the winter, you do not need to fertilize at all.\r\\n\r\\nThese are the basics of how to care for plants in your garden. As you can see, they are easy maintenance, high impact flowers that will make a garden in any part of the world look like a tropical paradise.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '199', 'annual flowering plant, best flower plant, flowering plant, flowers whole year, hardy plant, Hibiscus, Mini pink Hibiscus, small hibiscus plant', '', '', '', '', '', 'mini-pink-hibiscus-small-hibiscus-plant', ''),

There seems to be a little controversy in the books over whether this plant is easy or difficult to grow. The simple rule to follow is this: the lighter the variegation, the more light it needs. Otherwise, these are slow growing, dependably attractive and make excellent foliage plants. They have large, narrow oval leaves on short stems.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Growing Conditions</strong>\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Light:</strong>?The darker green varieties can grow in near shade, while the variegated varieties require brighter light. Do not expose to direct sun.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Water:</strong> Water thoroughly in the summer, and mist often to raise humidity. During the winter, reduce watering but do not let the plant dry completely. Seek to raise the humidity in general.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Temperature:</strong>?They do not like cold drafts or temperatures below 65?F. The warmer, the better.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Soil:</strong>?A well-drained potting soil is perfect.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Fertilizer:</strong>?Slow-release pellets or liquid fertilizer during the growing season.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Propagation:</strong>?Aglaonema are not typically propagated by home growers, but they can be divided during repotting. Small shoots can be potted as individual plants.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Repotting:</strong> They are slow-growing and will only need repotting every other year. Aglaonema is generally low-growing plants that will only very gradually reveal their trunks.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Varieties</strong>\r\\nAglaonema has been hybridized to produce interesting variegated leaves. The A. commutatum in widely available, in both the Silver Spear (variegated) form and a green form. A pure green A. modestum is seen more rarely. Beware the fruit of the A. crispum, which are toxic. Other variegated forms include A. pictum, A. silver queen (almost totally silver), and A. pseudobracteatum.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Grower\'s Tips</strong>\r\\nBecause of their high humidity requirements, some growers consider aglaonema to be greenhouse plants. It\'s true they will do best in the warm, humid and bright environment of a greenhouse, but they can successfully be grown indoors by coming as close as possible to these conditions. The number one rule to remember with aglaonema is this: keep them warm and moist.

English common names include: moringa drumstick tree (from the appearance of the long, slender, triangular seed-pods), horseradish tree (from the taste of the roots, which resembles horseradish), ben oil tree or benzoil tree (from the oil which is derived from the seeds). It is a fast-growing, drought-resistant tree, native to the southern foothills of the Himalayas in northwestern India, and widely cultivated in tropical and sub-tropical areas where its young seed pods and leaves are used as a vegetable.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Description</strong>\r\\nMoringa oleifera is a fast growing, evergreen, deciduous tree. It can reach a height of 10?12 m and the trunk can reach a diameter of 45 cm. The bark has a whitish-grey colour and is surrounded by thick cork. Young shoots have purplish or greenish-white hairy bark. The tree has an open crown of drooping, fragile branches and the leaves build up a feathery foliage of tripinnate leaves. The flowers are fragrant and bisexual, surrounded by five unequal thinly veined yellowish-white petals. The flowers are approximately 1-1.5 cm long and 2 cm broad. They grow on slender hairy stalks in spreading or drooping later flower clusters which have a longitude of 10?25 cm. Flowering begins within the first six months after planting. In seasonally cool regions, flowering will only occur once a year between April and June. In more constant seasonal temperature and with constant rainfall, flowering can happen twice or even all year-round.\r\\n\r\\nThe fruit is a hanging, three-sided brown capsule of 20?45 cm size which holds dark brown, globular seeds with a diameter of approximately 1 cm. The seeds have three whitish papery wings and are dispersed by wind and water. In cultivation, it is often cut back annually to 1?2 meters and allowed to regrow so the pods and leaves remain within arm\'s reach.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Fruits</strong>\r\\nWhen the plant is grown up from cuttings the first harvest can already take place after 6-8 month after plantation. Often, the fruits are not yielded in the first year and the yield is generally low during the first years. By year 2 it produces around 300 pods, by year 3 around 400-500. A good tree can yield 1000 or more pods. In India a hectare can produce 31 tons of pods per year. Under North Indian conditions the fruits ripen during the summer. Sometimes, particularly in South India, flowers and fruits appear twice a year and so there are 2 harvests, in July to September and March to April.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Leaves</strong>\r\\nAverage yields of 6 tons/ha/year in fresh matter are can be achieved. The harvest differs strongly between the rainy and dry season with 1120 kg/ha per harvest and 690 kg/ha per harvest. The leaves and stems can be harvested from the young plants 60 days after seeding and then another 7 times in the year. At every harvest the plants are cut back to within 60 cm of the ground. In some production systems the leaves are harvested every 2 weeks. Foidl. et al. (2001) showed that the cultivation of Moringa oleifera can also be done intensively with irrigation and fertilization with suitable varieties.

The ascorbic acid content of guava varies from 75 to 260 mg/100g depending on the cultivar, season, location, and stage of maturity. The fruits harvested during the winter season are superior in quality in comparison to rainy season fruits. It contains a considerable amount of Ca, P, and Fe.

With a typical height and spread of around 30 feet, spring fruiting and yellow flowers and bronze-hued leaves, this tree is a showstopper. However, ensuring that your lychee tree performs up to its potential means providing it with the special care it needs for healthy development.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Cultural Requirements</strong>\r\\n\r\\nProviding trees with special care is effective only if the plant is already growing in optimal conditions. Lychee trees grow best in areas of the home garden that offer full sunlight, which is particularly significant for healthy flowering and fruit growth. These evergreens thrive in most soil types, provided that soil is moist and well-drained. The ideal pH range is 5.0 to 7.5, as alkalinity may result in an iron deficiency. Lychee trees grow most successfully in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 10a through 11.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Soil Care</strong>\r\\n\r\\nLychee trees are water lovers and should be irrigated regularly. However, avoid creating waterlogged conditions, which may result in diminished health or root rot. Irrigation for this shallow-rooted tree should occur when the soil feels dry to the touch. However, ceasing watering approximately six weeks prior to flowering helps promote fruiting, according to the University of California Cooperative Extension. To maintain the high fertility lychees need, fertilizer, such as 10-5-20, should be applied after harvest. An additional application is suitable after the fruit set, suggests the University of Hawaii at Manoa.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Pest Control</strong>\r\\n\r\\nWhile lychee trees are resistant to most diseases, they may fall victim to pests, such as aphids, during flush growth. Citrus aphids (Toxoptera aurantii) attack foliage, sucking out plant tissue fluid, which leads to leaf curl. These pests display tiny, black, oval bodies measuring approximately 1/25 to 1/12 inch in length. Aphids also secrete a sticky, sweet substance called honeydew, which oozes onto plant parts and the ground below. Where honeydew lands, a black fungal disease called sooty mould develops. Sooty mould may block out sunlight when it covers plant parts. In addition, citrus aphids have the potential to transmit viral diseases to plants. To control these pests, the release of natural enemies, such as syrphid predators and parasitic wasps, provides effective control. Though the damage is unsightly, control is rarely necessary. In severe cases, however, applications of insecticidal oil offer management when applied as soon as symptoms occur.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '550', '600', 'litchi, lychee, lychee plant', '', '', '', '', '', 'lychee-litchi-plant-air-layered', ''),

When you know how to care for hibiscus plants, you will be rewarded with many years of lovely flowers. Let?s look at some tips on how to care for hibiscus.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Growing Hibiscus in Containers</strong>\r\\nMany people who are growing a hibiscus plant choose to do so in a container. This allows them to move the hibiscus plant to ideal locations, depending on the time of year. Hibiscus plants prefer a cosy fit when growing in a container. This means that they should be slightly root bound in the pot and when you do decide to re-pot, only give the hibiscus a little bit more room. Always make sure that your growing hibiscus plant has excellent drainage.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Temperatures for Growing Hibiscus</strong>\r\\nWhen you care for a hibiscus, you should remember that hibiscus flower best in temperatures between 60 F. ? 90 F. and cannot tolerate temps below? 32 F. In the summer, your hibiscus plant can go outside but once the weather starts to get near freezing, it is time for you to bring your hibiscus indoors.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Planting Instructions</strong>\r\\nPlant in spring, summer, or fall, spacing plants 3 to 6 feet apart. Dig a hole only as deep as the root ball and 2 to 3 times as wide. If your soil is in very poor condition, amend the soil you\'ve removed from the hole with a small amount of compost. Otherwise don\'t amend it at all. Carefully remove the plant from the container and set it in the hole. Fill the hole half full with soil, then water it well to settle the soil and eliminate air pockets. Let the water drain, then fill the remainder of the hole with soil and water thoroughly.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Care</strong>\r\\nHibiscus require at least 1 inch of rain (or equivalent watering) each week. They like to be constantly moist, but not wet. Feed twice a month during the growing season and prune as necessary to control plant size and cut back errant branches. Cut branches back to just above a side shoot. Hibiscus are sensitive to cold and should be protected when temperatures dip into the 30s; container-grown plants should be brought indoors. Check plants periodically for pests such as aphids, whiteflies, and mealybugs. Use a horticultural oil or insecticidal soap to control these pests.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Watering Hibiscus</strong>\r\\nWhen hibiscus is in their blooming stage, they require large amounts of water. Your hibiscus will need daily watering in warm weather. But once the weather cools, your hibiscus needs far less water, and too much water can kill it. In the winter, water your hibiscus only when the soil is dry to the touch.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Fertilizing Hibiscus</strong>\r\\nA growing hibiscus plant needs lots of nutrients in order to bloom well. In the summer, use a high potassium fertilizer. You can either use a diluted liquid fertilizer once a week, a slow-release fertilizer once a month or you can add a high potassium compost to the soil. In the winter, you do not need to fertilize at all.\r\\n\r\\nThese are the basics for how to care for hibiscus plants in your garden. As you can see, they are easy maintenance, high impact flowers that will make a garden in any part of the world look like a tropical paradise.\r\\n\r\\n</div>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '499', 'Gudhal, Hibiscus, jason plant', '', '', '', '', '', 'double-petal-hibiscus-plant-red-color-gudhal-double-petal', ''),

There are many different species of Philodendrons, each possessing its own characteristics as to leaf size, shape, or colouring. Some species climb while others remain in more of a shrub shape.\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>A?Split Leaf Philodendron, Monstera deliciosa</li>\r\\n  <li>Split Leaf Philodendron</li>\r\\n  <li>Monstera deliciosa?? ?A Large Selloum, Elephant Ear Philodendron, P. bipinnatifidum</li>\r\\n  <li>Elephant Ear Philodendron</li>\r\\n  <li>Philodendron bipinnatifidum</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n<h5><strong>Growing Requirements for Philodendron Plants</strong></h5>\r\\nMost Philodendrons are native to the jungles of tropical America, and as such, prefer the medium light intensity they would have on the jungle floor. They will tolerate low light, but if there is too little light, the new leaves will develop smaller, and farther apart on the stem.\r\\nOn the other hand, direct sunlight will burn the foliage, and stunt the growth of the plant. Keep the soil evenly moist, but allow it to dry out between waterings. Keep Philodendrons slightly drier during the winter months, when the growth slows.\r\\nOverwatering will cause the leaves to turn yellow. Underwatering will cause the leaves to turn brown and fall off.\r\\n\r\\nFeed your <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philodendron\">Philodendron</a> in the spring and again in mid-summer with a liquid house plant fertilizer. The ideal growing temperature is between 75 and 85 degrees F. during the day and in the 60\'s at night. Philodendron Plants will survive for a short time in temperatures as low as 36 degrees F. Wash the leaves regularly to prevent the pores from becoming plugged with dust.\r\\n\r\\nPhilodendrons will tolerate the level of humidity found in most homes, but high humidity promotes lush growth and shiny foliage, so it is a good idea to mist the plant regularly.\r\\n<h5><strong>Repotting Philodendron Plants</strong></h5>\r\\nPhilodendrons grow best when their roots are slightly cramped, (but not too cramped), so don\'t plant them in a pot that is too large. When the roots begin to compact into a tight ball, the plant should be repotted into a planter that is 2-3 inches larger. Repotting should be done in late winter or spring before the plant begins active new growth. Good drainage is essential, so if there are no drainage holes, be sure to fill the bottom of the pot with clean stones or broken crockery.\r\\n\r\\nUse a good commercial potting soil or a mixture consisting of equal parts of loam, sand, and peat moss, with some chopped charcoal, gravel, broken crocks or brick added. Newly potted plants need to be carefully watered during the first month or so, to be certain that the roots don\'t dry out completely. Never allow the soil to become saturated or soggy. It\'s especially helpful to mist the leaves of newly planted Philodendrons two or three times a day.\r\\n\r\\nIt is also a good idea to add a moss stake or other type of pole to the planter at the time of repotting if this is a climbing or vining type of Philodendron. As the plant grows, it will need some sort of support. The are several types of plant poles available at garden centers. Some types of Philodendrons produce aerial roots which will cling to whatever support they find.\r\\n\r\\nThese roots should never be cut off completely, but they can be trimmed back if they become too long, or begin to die back. It is far better to attach these roots to the support pole, or lead them back to the pot where they can grow into the soil.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '425', '499', 'Philodendron, philodendron atom, philodendron selloum, Thaumatophyllum bipinnatifidum, xanadu', '', '', '', '', '', 'philodendron-atom-plant-thaumatophyllum-bipinnatifidum', ''),

They are mostly vines, with some being shrubs, and a few species being herbaceous. For information about the fruit of the passiflora plant, see passionfruit. The monotypic genus Hollrungia seems to be inseparable from Passiflora, but further study is needed.\r\\n<h4><strong>Ecology</strong></h4>\r\\nThe passion flowers have a unique structure, which in most cases requires a large bee to effectively pollinate. In the American tropics, wooden beams are mounted very near passionfruit plantings to encourage carpenter bees to nest. The size and structure of flowers of other Passiflora species is optimized for pollination by hummingbirds (especially hermits like Phaethornis), bumblebees, wasps, or bats, while yet others are self-pollinating. The Sword-billed Hummingbird (Ensifera) with its immensely elongated bill has co-evolved with certain passion flowers, such as P. mixta.\r\\n\r\\nYellow Passion Flower (P. lutea) pollen is apparently the only pollen eaten by the unusual bee Anthemurgus passiflora. However, these bees simply collect the pollen but do not pollinate the flowers.\r\\n\r\\nThe leaves are used as food plants by the larva of a number of Lepidoptera. To prevent the butterflies from laying too many eggs on any single plant, some passion flowers bear small colored nubs which resemble the butterflies\' eggs and seem to fool them into believing that more eggs have already been deposited on a plant than actually is the case. Also, many Passiflora species produce sweet nutrient-rich liquid from glands on their leaf stems. These fluids attract ants which will kill and eat many pests that they happen to find feeding on the passion flowers.\r\\n<h4><strong>Medicinal</strong></h4>\r\\nPassiflora incarnata (maypop) leaves and roots have a long history of use among Native Americans in North America and were adapted by the European colonists. The fresh or dried leaves of maypop are used to make a tea that is used for insomnia, hysteria, and epilepsy, and is also valued for its analgesic properties. P. edulis (passion fruit) and a few other species are used in Central and South America for similar purposes. Once dried, the leaves can also be smoked.\r\\n\r\\nThe medical utility of only a few species of Passiflora has been scientifically studied. In an initial study in 2001 for treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, maypop extract was performed as well as oxazepam but with fewer short-term side effects. It was recommended to follow up with long-term studies to confirm these results.\r\\n\r\\nIn a study performed on mice, it was shown that Passiflora alata has a genotoxic effect on cells, and further research was recommended before this one species is considered safe for human consumption.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '299', 'Krishna Kamal, Krishna kamal red, Passiflora, passion flower, passion flower red', '', '', '', '', '', 'passiflora-incarnata-plant-passion-flower-krishnakamal-passiflora-red', ''),

Europeans have been using them as indoor plants since the mid-1800s and they?ve been popular in the United States since the early twentieth century. Corn plants are grown as thick canes that sprout from buds along with the cane, achieving a ?false palm? effect (they?re sometimes called false palms). They make good houseplants because they are tall and narrow, with controlled growth, and can withstand a fairly significant amount of abuse from casual indoor gardeners.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Growing Conditions</strong>\r\\n<strong>Light:</strong>?Try to locate them near a window with filtered sun. Too little light will result in leaves losing their stripes.\r\\n<strong>Water:?</strong>Keep evenly moist, but if you have to err, do so on the dry side. Keeping it too dry, however, will result in brown leaf tips. They prefer about 40% humidity. Use non-fluoridated water as they are sensitive to fluoride.\r\\n<strong>Temperature:</strong>?Keep above 55?F if possible. They do best in the mid-70?s.\r\\n<strong>Soil:</strong>?Loose, well-drained potting mix.\r\\n<strong>Fertilizer:</strong>?Fertilize lightly since the plants store nutrients in their canes. Use calcium supplements (chelated calcium or even gypsum) to prevent leaf-tip burn.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Propagation</strong>\r\\nCorn plants root readily from cuttings. Push tip cuttings into warm soil and keep moist. You can also root cane pieces directly by pushing them into a growing medium. Make sure the dirt is strong enough to support the cane upright. Rooting hormones can help increase rooting.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Repotting</strong>\r\\nRepot annually into larger pots with fresh, free-draining potting soil. The true Dracaena fragrans has solid green leaves, but most people prefer the D. fragrans ?Massangeana,? which features a central, broad lime-green stripe down the middle of the leaf. Another variety, D. fragrans ?Lindenii,? has a dark green stripe down the middle and yellowish leaves. A final variety, D. frangrans ?Victoria,? has white and cream stripes, but is rarely seen in garden centres.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Grower\'s Tips</strong>\r\\nCorn plants are often sold in groups of three canes in larger pots perfect for a spot on the floor by the window.

Well, first of all you need to live in a humid tropical to near tropical climate.\r\\n\r\\nGrowing jackfruit trees are extremely sensitive to frost and cannot abide drought. They flourish in rich, deep and somewhat porous soil.

The black mulberry (Morus nigra) is native to Iran and can be exceptionally long-lived, bearing fruit for centuries. The white mulberry (M. alba) was the species used in the silk trade to feed silkworms.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Planning the crop</strong>\r\\n\r\\nMulberries are particularly tough and unfussy. Only in really cold districts will they fail to thrive. They can be grown either as bushes or standard trees. Some varieties of the latter eventually achieve a height of 10m or more, which is too big for most modern gardens. Varieties that reach half that size are available.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>How many to grow-</strong> Mulberries are self-fertile, and a single tree would be ample for most families.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Varieties-</strong> The two species are the black mulberry, which produces fine dark fruit, and the white mulberry, with pale fruit that is relatively tasteless. There are some excellent culinary varieties: Hicks Everbearing; Hicks Fancy; Johnson; Downing; Stubbs, best suited to warm districts; Black English, not exceeding 5 m; and the very long fruiting Black Persian.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Growing tips</strong>\r\\n\r\\nThe usual way to acquire a mulberry is by purchasing a young tree from a nursery. Most are grown in containers; plant any time the weather is suitable. Plant the young tree in an open, sunny position in well-manured soil, taking particular care not to damage the roots. Avoid planting near paths as the fruit is messy.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Soil</strong>- Mulberries need a well-drained, preferably loamy and slightly acidic soil with an ideal pH of 6-6.5. They generally need little fertiliser if the soil conditions are right. An annual dose of slow-release granular fertiliser should be all that?s needed.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Raising new plants-</strong> Take a cutting from a friend?s tree in either autumn or early spring, preferably a 30 cm cutting that has some two-year-old wood at the base. Plant the cutting deeply so that all but two or three buds are buried below ground. Alternatively, you could try rooting longer, larger branches, as they have a good chance of success, too. Be sure to trim off any lateral branches and bury about half the main branch in the soil. Large branches can be planted in the position where the tree is to grow, but shorter cuttings are better grown in a nursery bed for a year or two until they are well-rooted. Avoid using any shoots that are growing from near the base of the original tree. The more desirable black mulberry was sometimes grafted onto a white mulberry, and the basal shoots may therefore be of the less desirable white species.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Pruning</strong>- Mulberries tend to bleed when cut, so avoid heavy pruning. Remove deadwood or inward-growing branches that rub against neighbouring branches in late autumn to early spring.\r\\n\r\\nPests and diseases\r\\n\r\\nBirds may strip much of the crop of ripe fruit unless the tree is netted. The main disease is canker.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Harvesting and storing</strong>\r\\n\r\\nThe best way to gather mulberries is to wait until they ripen in early autumn, then spread a cloth or large sheet of plastic beneath the branches and shake the tree gently. Any unripe fruit can remain on the tree to be gathered later.\r\\n\r\\n</div>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '499', 'mulberry, nigra, shahtoot, tuti', '', '', '', '', '', 'mulberry-shahtoot-tuti-plant', ''),

The rounder variety which I planted does not look like kiwifruit except for the color. Chiku is spelt differently in different countries, but retaining the same pronunciation. Other names for chiku are sawo (Indonesia), sapota (part of India), lamoot (Thailand, Laos and Cambodia), sapote, sapodilla, zapote, sapoti, nispero, dilly, naseberry, chico sapote, and many other names. In Malaysia, we called it chiku. Its scientific name is Manilkara zapota.\r\\n\r\\nThe chiku is native to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. It was first introduced to the Philippines by the Spaniards. Now the chiku is a common fruit in South East Asia, India and Pakistan.\r\\n\r\\nThe tree can grow to a height of 30 meters (100 feet) high. However, a grafted plant can be controlled to a low height. I have one grafted chiku tree which is less than 10 feet high with controlled pruning. Take a look at the picture below. The tree is very hardy. I planted this chiku tree as a replacement for the rambutan tree which did not survive. I am completely satisfied with this chiku tree as it fruits easily throughout the year, although the fruits take a long time to ripen. The flowers are minute and white in color, not attractive at all.\r\\n\r\\nManilkara zapota, commonly known as the sapodilla is a long-lived, evergreen tree native to southern Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. An example of natural occurrence is in coastal Yucat?n in the Petenes mangroves ecoregion, where it is a subdominant plant species.[4] It was introduced to the Philippines during Spanish colonization. It is grown in large quantities in India, Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Mexico.\r\\n\r\\nSapota, popularly known in India as Chiku. In India, it is cultivated for fruits that are liked all over the country. The fruit is a fleshy berry, variable in shape, size, and weight (75-150g).

Annual & hardy plant, beautiful texture on leaves.</li>\r\\n</ul>', '<h3>Variegated Aralia Plant</h3>\r\\nA low-maintenance houseplant, aralias require little specialized care and fare best in warm, humid rooms. Aralias are prone to infestation by various insects, so inspect them regularly for signs of bugs.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Light and Heat</strong>\r\\nNo matter the species, aralia plants need light to mimic the tropical climate of their native Polynesia. Though they will survive under low light as they long as they have moist soil, they do best in medium or full sun when grown indoors, but should be planted in shady areas if placed outside. Aralias prefer temperatures between 60 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit, so keep them inside or move them indoors during the winter.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Watering</strong>\r\\nThe thin, fine roots of aralias are subject to rot, so allow the upper half of the soil to thoroughly dry out between waterings. If grown under low light, they may need water just once or twice a month, so monitor the soil carefully. In the winter, the growth of aralias slows considerably and they require even less water. If conditions outside are wet, provide them with shelter or move them inside to prevent root rot.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Soil, Fertilizer, and Pruning</strong>\r\\nWhen growing aralias, use a light, peat-based potting soil and place the plant in a small pot as a precaution against overwatering. This type of soil allows for proper aeration and drainage, preventing the plant\'s roots from becoming waterlogged. Feed aralias with a granular, controlled-release fertilizer with a high nitrogen content every other month. Prune the tips of aralia plants to promote the growth of new leaves and to help maintain its full, lush appearance.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Problems</strong>\r\\nUnfortunately, aralias are at risk of infestation by spider mites, aphids, mealybugs, and scale insects. To keep mites at bay, prune and discard infested parts of the plant and rinse the aralia in the shower, washing away bugs. Scale insects can also be controlled by pruning and, for outdoor aralias, introduce natural predators like lacewings and ladybugs. For aphids, introduce parasitic wasps. Both ladybugs and parasitic wasps will help keep mealybugs away, as will commercial pesticides.\r\\n\r\\n \r\\n<div class=\"cell\">\r\\n<div class=\"cell medium-4\">\r\\n<div class=\"grid-x grid-padding-x grid-padding-y\">\r\\n<div class=\"cell small-3 medium-12 large-2\"><img class=\"section-image\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0150/6262/t/124/assets/pdp-plant-care-icon_three-quarter-sun.png?v=3916211972997425883\" alt=\"Light Tip\" width=\"56\" height=\"52\"></div>\r\\n<div class=\"cell small-9 medium-12 large-10\">\r\\n<h6 class=\"plant-care-title\">LIGHT</h6>\r\\n<p class=\"section-content\">Thrives in medium to bright indirect light,</p>\r\\n\r\\n</div>\r\\n</div>\r\\n</div>\r\\n<div class=\"cell medium-4\">\r\\n<div class=\"grid-x grid-padding-x grid-padding-y\">\r\\n<div class=\"cell small-3 medium-12 large-2\"><img class=\"section-image\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0150/6262/t/124/assets/pdp-plant-care-icon_water-biweekly.png?v=17626310380393541439\" alt=\"Water Tip\" width=\"53\" height=\"52\"></div>\r\\n<div class=\"cell small-9 medium-12 large-10\">\r\\n<h6 class=\"plant-care-title\">WATER</h6>\r\\n<p class=\"section-content\">Water once in a week, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings.

The tropical-looking plants feature variegated leaves and quickly spread and cover bare, shady areas in the summer garden. Alocasia grows as a perennial in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 8 through 11, depending on the specific variety. With proper planting and care, the plant can survive winter and provide summer greenery for years.\r\\n\r\\nAlocasia growth can be broken into two categories: one category of Alocasia prefers moist soil (the green leaf types) and the other prefers very well-drained soil on the drier side. (Amozonica) Alocasia is commonly referred to as Elephant Ear, the huge green to deep purple leaves bear a likeness to the ears of an elephant. Alocasia will adjust its size according to the amount of sun it receives. The more sun it receives the smaller it will be, the less sun it receives the larger it will become \"to a point\". In some cultivars, the difference can be staggering. The green leaf cultivars such as Calidora and California love water these types will grow well alongside a pond or lake. Other cultivars prefer drier soil and if kept moist will develop crown rot these varieties are Longiloba, Amazonica and other like kinds. When growing the green type in the home landscape we recommend morning sun and afternoon shade in an area with an ample water supply.\r\\n\r\\nThis will produce huge, broad leaves in Alocasia Calidora. We recommend a soil rich in organic fertilizer with composted manure. Compost should be worked into the soil at a ratio of 1/40 lb bag per 16 sq. ft. this ratio will produce the best results. A slow-release 12-month balanced fertilizer applied in the spring will provide nutrients throughout the growing season. When fall arrives the plants should be allowed to die back by restricting water or the onset of frost at this point the bulbs can be brought in for the winter in zones 7 or above or left in the ground in zones 8 and higher. Most Alocasia prefers high humidity and grows larger faster in humid conditions. Alocasia can also be grown as a terrarium plant and tend to thrive in humid conditions. Amazonica does well in moderate humidity and when placed in the controlled environment of a terrarium the results can be spectacular thus giving virtually anyone the ability to tend a piece of the tropics. Alocasia flowers are borne readily in upright clusters throughout the growing season as a spath-type flower and have a mild to fragrant smell depending on the species. I recommend trying Alocasia Calidora for first-time growers but remember to leave room in your garden because you will have to have more.\r\\n<h4>Care for Alocasia plant</h4>\r\\n<strong>Site and Soil</strong>\r\\nAlocasia tolerates both sun and shade, but it performs best when planted in partially shaded garden beds. A site with full morning sunlight but afternoon shade provides a better location than a bed that receives sunlight all day. Alocasia also requires soil that remains moist and doesn\'t dry out completely. Working 2 to 4 inches of compost into the site before you plant helps the soil retain moisture while also supplying organic matter. Avoid sandy soil that drains and dries quickly.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Planting</strong>\r\\nThe rhizomes, or tuberous roots, require frost-free weather to grow and avoid cold damage, so they are usually planted in spring after frost danger passes. You can also start them indoors six weeks earlier in pots, then transplant the actively growing plants outdoors after frost. Plant tubers 2 to 3 inches deep in the prepared planting site or pot. The proper spacing depends on the alocasia variety, but generally, the plants require between 3 and 5 feet of space to spread their large leaves.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Basic Care</strong>\r\\nThe primary care consideration is water. Depending on weather conditions, alocasia can require frequent irrigation. Water when the top 1/2 inch of soil begins to dry. Growing in shade and mulching the bed prevents the soil from drying too quickly, but the plants might still require two or more waterings a week during dry weather. Alocasia benefits from slow-release fertilizer applied every two months during the growing season. Use a fertilizer formulated for foliage plants and apply it at the package-recommended rate. Spider mites might infest the leaves. Rinse the pests off the foliage with a sharp spray of water, or treat with a miticide applied according to package directions.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Winter Tips</strong>\r\\nThe cold hardiness of alocasia varies depending on the variety, but most can\'t tolerate frost. The foliage usually dies back and can be removed in fall. In mild climates that rarely experience prolonged frosts, covering the roots with 2 to 3 inches of mulch usually provides enough insulation for winter protection. Less hardy alocasia varieties, or those grown in cooler areas, must be dug up and overwintered indoors. Store the tubers in dry peat moss in a cool basement or garage, where temperatures remain above freezing until you replant in spring.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '399', '450', 'Alocasia, Alocasia bambino, Alocasia lowii \'Bebe, elephant ear', '', '', '', '', '', 'alocasia-bambino-arrow-plant', ''),

The attractive flowers of adeniums and their interesting bottle-shaped trunk make them desirable for the garden.\r\\n\r\\nAdeniums are easy to grow plants and thrive in a humid, tropical climate like India, Thailand, and the Philippines. As a hardy and tough plant Adenium needs very little care, the only way to kill one of these plants is to over water or leaves it exposed to low temperatures. If a few simple precautions are taken, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenium\">Adenium</a> also thrives in cool, wet climates.\r\\n<h5><strong>Cultivation and uses:</strong></h5>\r\\nAdenium obesum is grown as a houseplant in temperate regions. Numerous hybrids have been developed. Adeniums are appreciated for their colorful flowers, but also for their unusual, thick caudices. They can be grown for many years in a pot and are commonly used for bonsai.\r\\n\r\\nBecause seed-grown plants are not genetically identical to the mother plant, desirable varieties are commonly propagated by grafting. Genetically identical plants can also be propagated by cutting. However, cutting-grown plants do not tend to develop a desirable thick caudex as quickly as seed-grown plants.\r\\n<h5><strong>Light:</strong></h5>\r\\nAdenium requires direct sunlight and fresh air; plants grown in shade will flower poorly, become leggy, and are more susceptible to diseases. However, it is necessary to protect the newly exposed portions (caudex) from direct sun, or sunscald may occur.\r\\n<h5><strong>Temperature:</strong></h5>\r\\nAdeniums in general responds to high temperatures. An ideal temperature for better growth and flowering is 30-35? Celsius, preferably accompanied by moderate to high humidity. However, growth and flowering seem to be suppressed by temperatures consistently above 38? Celsius. Dormancy is induced in all taxa when nights regularly fall below about10? Celsius. When completely dry and dormant they can tolerate near-freezing temperatures, though there is an increased risk of root-rot below 10? Celsius. At 10? Celsius branch tips will be damaged, however, the plant will survive; prolonged exposure below 10? Celsius causes serious damage or death.\r\\n<h5><strong>Water:</strong></h5>\r\\nProper watering is the key to keeping your Adenium healthy. The frequency of watering depends on the container and soil mix used to plant and of course temperature. Adenium needs more water when plants actively growing and hot summer days. During monsoon and winter water requirement is less as soil retains moisture for a longer period due to slow absorption by plants.\r\\n<h5><strong>Soil:</strong></h5>\r\\nDesert rose requires excellent drainage in any soil mix; if it is not provided, the roots rot, resulting in poor growth or death of the plant. The soil mix also must have moisture retention properties, along with adequate nutrients. Use a mixture of one part coarse sand, half part coco peat, and half part worm compost or well-rotted cow dung, which will hold some moisture but still drain nicely.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Container:</strong> Desert rose can also be grown in any container that permits good drainage. Unglazed ceramic pots are ideal, in that they allow the soil to dry out between watering. If a clay pot is used it must be wide enough to allow for expansion of the caudex, otherwise, the container may crack. Whether you use plastic or ceramic is entirely up to personal preference but you must keep in mind that clay pots dry out much faster than plastic.\r\\n<h5><strong>Fertilizer:</strong></h5>\r\\nDuring the first 2?3 yrs, young plants make rapid growth if provided with adequate fertilizer, then growth slows down as they mature. Give young plants a full strength complete liquid fertilizer every 2 wks. For more mature plants, reduce or eliminate the liquid fertilizer, but use a slow-release fertilizer.\r\\n<h5><strong>Repotting:</strong></h5>\r\\nRoot prune and repot every year or two, using a good draining soil mix such as described above. The plant can tolerate being root-bound (tight in the pot.)\r\\n<h5><strong>Pruning:</strong></h5>\r\\nUsually pruning is done to reduce overall plant size, or to selectively remove branches to \'sculpt\' a more-perfect plant\r\\n<h5><strong>Pest and Diseases:</strong></h5>\r\\nThe common enemies of Desert Rose are aphids, mealybugs, spider mites, caterpillars, sometimes scale insects, and fungus. Bugs are pretty easy to handle if you observe and inspect your Desert Rose often ...you\'ll see the pests and can take action. Sometimes, the leaves are eaten by small worm. If the trouble is not serious, just remove the worm out of the plant.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '599', '650', 'Adenium Lemon Ice, Adenium Obesum, Desert Rose Plant, Impala Lily, Kudu, Mock Azalea, Pink Adenium, Red Adenium, Sabi Star', '', '', '', '', '', 'adenium-desert-rose-impala-lily-plant', ''),

Hybridizers have expanded the range of colours from the familiar red to pastel yellow and vibrant bi-colours. One of the most common questions after Christmas is ?How can I care for my poinsettia so that it will bloom again next Christmas??. While this can be done, it\'s a very fussy, exacting process and since the plants are not that expensive, you might just choose to start fresh next year.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Light -?</strong>Place it near a sunny window. South, east or west-facing windows are preferable to a north-facing window. Poinsettias are tropical and will appreciate as much direct sunlight as you can provide.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Heat -?</strong>To keep the poinsettia in bloom as long as possible, maintain a temperature of 65 - 75 degrees F. during the day. Dropping the temperature to about 60 degrees F. at night will not hurt the plant. However, cold drafts or allowing the leaves to touch a cold window can injure the leaves and cause premature leaf drop. If you\'ve ever seen a gangly poinsettia in bloom, with only a couple of sad looking leaves hanging on, it was probably exposed to temperatures that were too cool or extreme shifts in temperature.\r\\n\r\\n<b>Water- Water</b> the plant whenever the surface feels dry to the touch. Water until it drains out the bottom, but don\'t let the plant sit in water. Wilting is another common cause of leaf drop. A wilted plant can be revived and salvaged, but it will take another season to improve its appearance.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Humidity -</strong>?Lack of humidity during dry seasons, in particular winter, is an ongoing houseplant problem. If your home tends to be dry and your poinsettia is in direct light, you will find yourself watering frequently, possibly every day.\r\\n\r\\nWith proper care, your poinsettia will last through the holiday season and right into late winter. Pay close attention to the following tips:\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Place in a room where there is bright natural light but not where the sun will shine directly on the plant.</li>\r\\n  <li>Keep the plant away from locations where it will receive hot or cold draughts.</li>\r\\n  <li>Place the plant high enough to be out of reach of unmonitored children and pets.</li>\r\\n  <li>Set the plant in a water-proof container to protect your furniture.</li>\r\\n  <li>Water the plant thoroughly when the soil surface is dry to the touch. Discard any excess water which remains in the saucer after 10 minutes.</li>\r\\n  <li>The bright colour of the bracts will remain longer if temperatures do not exceed 22?C.</li>\r\\n</ul>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '550', '999', 'christmas flower, poinsettia, Poinsettia plant', '', '', '', '', '', 'poinsettia-plant-christmas-flower', ''),

Cryptanthus bromeliads are unique in that they only grow terrestrially as opposed to many other bromeliads that can grow mounted on a substrate. The genus gets its name from the Greek word meaning hidden flower.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Potting</strong>\r\\n\r\\nAs opposed to other bromeliads that have very small root systems which only act as anchors, Cryptanthus has a more developed root system. Its roots can be expected to grow to at least the same width as its foliage. While their root systems are larger. a five or six-inch pot should still provide adequate space for the plant to grow. Using plastic pots will help maintain moisture. It is wise to use a pot that is wider than it is deep. Earth Stars will thrive when potted in a medium that maintains some moisture. Speciality potting mixes are available at garden centres and nurseries. You can also mix your own with sand, peat and perlite.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Fertilizer</strong>\r\\n\r\\nIn order to maximize growth, Cryptanthus should be fertilized. Cryptanthus will thrive on any balanced fertilizer such as 10-10-10 or 14-14-14.? It is important, however, to significantly dilute the solution down to a quarter of the strength recommended. This highly diluted solution can be used every time you water. The Cryptanthus Society recommends using a time-release granular fertilizer when first planting pups.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Light</strong>\r\\n\r\\nCryptanthus varieties require different amounts of lights. Most Cryptanthus prefer indirect sunlight. Shade from tall trees outdoors or a sunny room without direct sun exposure is ideal for Cryptanthus. As mentioned above, Cryptanthus are adapted to survive under the cover of trees in humid climates. Too much direct sun can cause bleached or sunburned areas on the plant?s leaves. If your plant seems stressed and these marks appear, move your bromeliad to a spot with less direct sunlight. On the other hand, if your plant does not get enough light it will begin to look light green in colour.\r\\n\r\\n</div>\r\\n</div>\r\\n</div>\r\\n</div>\r\\n</div>\r\\n</div>\r\\n</div>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '199', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'earth-star-plant-variegated-cryptanthus-bromiliad-m-cryptanthus-long', ''),

Known by many names ? money tree, water chestnut, guinea nut, and so many more ? this plant seems to have found its way into every plant shop around. Like any plant that?s bred for commercial or ornamental purposes, one of the key features of a wanted plant is a plant that is prolific, easy to grow, and tolerant of varying conditions. These plants are actually quite weedy in the tropics, often being grown as erosion-control trees.\r\\n\r\\nMoney Tree plants are very commonly found in homes and offices because of their ability to survive with minimal care. The money tree plant is also highly idolized by those who practice feng shui because they commonly sprout five leaves on a stem. Five is an important number in feng shui because it is believed that everything within the universe is made up of five distinct elements: water, wood, fire, earth and metal. It is believed that if you place a money tree plant in an area that is exposed to areas concerning money, the money tree plant will bring the owner good luck and fortune. Often adorned with red ribbons and symbols, the money tree plant is perfect as an office/business gift because of its ability to grow in low light, minimal watering and care, and the wealth and good fortune it brings.\r\\n\r\\n</div>\r\\n</div>\r\\n</div>\r\\n</div>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '999', 'guiana chestnut, guinea nut, Money tree plant, pachira aquatica, water chestnut', '', '', '', '', '', 'pachira-aquatica-money-tree-plant-guiana-chestnut', ''),

Spores are generated from leaf tissue. All plants that sporulate love moisture and can tolerate being perpetually moist (but not wet). It is theorized that in later plants, flowers and cones evolved from modified sporulating leaf structures.\r\\n\r\\nIf you?re looking for the perfect tropical houseplant, look no further than the Bird?s Nest Fern.

Many people enjoy growing jade plants in their homes and offices, and they are considered to be symbols of good luck. But you do not need to be lucky to learn what the proper care and maintenance of jade plants are. Keep reading to learn how to care for a jade plant.\r\\n<h3>How to Care for a Jade Plant</h3>\r\\nLearning about the care and maintenance of jade plants (Crassula ovata) is easy. The most important factors to consider when growing jade houseplants is water, light, temperature, and fertilizer.\r\\n<h4>Watering a Jade Plant</h4>\r\\nOne of the most important things, when you care for jade plants, is to make sure that they are watered properly. Never let a jade plant dry out completely. But also, do not water a jade plant too often, as this can cause root rot. Don?t water your jade plant on a schedule. Rather, water your jade plant when the top of the soil is just dry to the touch.\r\\n\r\\nIf your jade plant is losing leaves or has leaf spots, this is most commonly caused by too little water.\r\\n<h4>Sunlight Requirements of a Jade Plant</h4>\r\\nAnother important aspect of the care and maintenance of jade plants is how much sun they receive. They need full sun in order to grow properly. If they do not have full sun, they may become stunted and leggy.\r\\n<h4>Proper Temperature for Jade Plants</h4>\r\\nJade plant care instructions say that jade plants do best in day time temperatures of 65-75 degrees F. during the day and 50?55 degrees F. at night. That being said, if they get lots of sunlight, they will do fine in temperatures that are higher than this.\r\\n<h4>Fertilizing Your Jade Plant</h4>\r\\nFor proper jade plant care, you need to fertilize your jade plant about once every six months. Use a balanced water-soluble fertilizer. An important thing to keep in mind is that you should water your jade plant in a regular way and then water it with the fertilizer water. Never fertilize your jade plant when the soil is dry, as this will damage the roots.\r\\n\r\\nAs you can see, how to care for a jade plant is pretty simple. With a little TLC and proper jade plant care, your pretty jade plant might one day become a pretty jade tree.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '350', '399', 'Crassula ovata, Elephant Bush Plant, Home Decorative, Indoor plants, Jade Plant, Jade Plant Variegated, lucky plant, Portulacaria Afra Variegated', '', '', '', '', '', 'jade-plant-variegated-elephant-bush-plant-portulacaria-afra-variegated-lucky-plant', ''),

There is always an ongoing debate on what kind of pots to use for keeping plants. ?The discussion with respect to plastic versus <strong>ceramic planters</strong> is long-standing. A few nursery workers love plastic pots, others will just utilize earthenware or mud. Each sort has favourable circumstances and inconveniences, and houseplants live longer when their individual needs are met. Ceramic is a decent all-around decision; however, the best pot for keeping houseplants solid to a great extent relies upon the plant\'s dampness needs and how frequently you water.\r\\n<h4><strong>Here are a few advantages of using ceramic pots</strong></h4>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Ceramic pots additionally called unglazed mud, permit air and water development through the sides of the pot.</li>\r\\n  <li>Air development animates root development, which results in more advantageous plants.</li>\r\\n  <li>This likewise implies plants in ceramic pots require more water than plants in plastic pots.</li>\r\\n  <li>Coated fired pots don\'t dry out as fast, yet confine air trade. Like ceramic pots, plastic pots don\'t permit air trade and hold dampness longer.</li>\r\\n  <li>The diverse loads and thicknesses of ceramic and?<strong>plastic pots</strong> can be either a favourable position or an inconvenience, contingent upon what you look like at it.</li>\r\\n  <li>Ceramic pots are heavier than plastic, and more averse to tipping over. Yet, this additionally makes them harder to move them on the off chance that they\'re huge.</li>\r\\n  <li>Ceramic pots have thicker dividers than plastic.</li>\r\\n  <li>In the event that the houseplants are moved outside whenever during the year, the thick ceramic pot goes about as protection for the roots to secure against temperature changes.</li>\r\\n  <li>Ceramic pots should have drainage holes and thereby help the plant thrive better.</li>\r\\n  <li>Pot diameter is something important that one should consider. The size of the pot determines how well it can grow.</li>\r\\n</ul>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '130', '599', 'Ceramic, Ceramic Planter, Ceramic Pot, Planter, Pot', '', '', '', '', '', 'ceramic-planter-pot', ''),

They were originally found in Indonesia so they do well in the warm climates of our houses. They are a fairly easy plant to grow indoors if you follow the care instructions listed below.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Light and heat requirements</strong>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Crotons need a very brightly lit location so that they keep their bright colours. They enjoy a western or southern window location. If they have plenty of light the leaves will have more variegation and the colours will be brighter.</li>\r\\n  <li>They need to be kept at a minimum temperature of 60?F during the night and around 70?F during the daytime. If they aren?t kept at this temperature they will begin to drop their leaves.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n<strong>Water requirements</strong>\r\\nCrotons need to have their soil evenly moist at all times, they tend to wilt easily if the soil is too dry. On the other hand, if the soil is too wet the leaves will turn brown on the edges. These plants also prefer to have a location with higher humidity. It is generally recommended that they be placed somewhere with a humidity of 40-80%. If the humidity isn?t high enough the plants will drop some of their leaves and the colour of the leaves may not be as vibrant.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Common problems</strong>\r\\nThe most common problem that people experience with crotons is spider mites. If the humidity is too low this tends to make them very susceptible to spider mites. The best way to get rid of the pests is to apply a miticide and mist them daily.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Sunlight</strong>\r\\nPlant crotons where they will receive direct sunlight for at least six to eight hours a day. They can grow as tall as 6 feet and up to 3 feet wide with enough light. Their green leaves turn to shades of yellow, red and purple throughout the year, showing their brightest colours in the sun in cooler months.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Weather Conditions</strong>\r\\nCrotons are evergreen plants and will continue to grow throughout winter when they show off their colours. Crotons grow best at between 60 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Lower night or seasonal temperatures will not harm the plants, as they are hardy enough to withstand temperatures as low as 40 F. However, it is wise to cover a bed of crotons or bring potted ones indoors if a frost is expected. The plants can tolerate heat as high as 100 F but should have some shade in areas that experience severe heat.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Water</strong>\r\\nWell-drained soil works best for growing crotons outdoors so the soil can dry between waterings. Pots should provide good drainage, as well. Water the plants when the top of the soil is dry. On especially hot days, you may need to water the crotons twice a day. Crotons like humid weather, and misting the plants throughout the hottest days of summer will help the leaves stay bright and healthy.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Fertilizer</strong>\r\\nOutdoor crotons require fertilizer with a recommended ratio of 3-1-2 (3 per cent nitrogen, 1 per cent phosphorus and 2 per cent potassium). Liquid or gradual-release granular fertilizer work well, using amounts listed on the packaging. Too much fertilizer can damage the roots and cause the leaves to be dull instead of bright and shiny.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Pests</strong>\r\\nAlthough crotons are generally pest-free, they can be affected by a few garden pests. Mealybugs are a type of scale insect that show up as white cottony masses. Mites are eight-legged insects that cause the leaves to become curled or speckled. Thrips are commonly called \"greenhouse thrips,\" and often attack newly developed plants. They leave scarred or calloused spots where they feed. These pests can be treated with a pesticide developed for tropical plants or houseplants.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '450', '500', 'codieaum variegatum, Golden Petra, leopard plant, Little white soldier, spotted leaf drimiopsis', '', '', '', '', '', 'croton-petra-plant', ''),

Asparagus Ferns produce tiny white flowers in late summer to fall, and will occasionally form red or blackberries. They can be trained to cascade down from a hanging planter, or to grow up a totem as a vine.\r\\n\r\\nThe asparagus fern plant (Asparagus aethiopicus syn. Asparagus densiflorus) is normally found in a hanging basket, decorating the deck or patio in summer and helping to clean indoor air in winter. The asparagus fern plant is not really a fern at all, but a member of the Liliaceae family. When growing asparagus ferns outside, place them in part sun to shady location for best foliage growth. While the asparagus fern plant may sometimes flower, the tiny white flowers are small and not necessary for the beauty of growing asparagus fern.\r\\n<h3><strong>Information on Asparagus Fern Care</strong></h3>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Growing asparagus fern is easy. The frilly, feathery asparagus fern plant appears soft and fuzzy, but when taking care of asparagus ferns you may be surprised to find they have thorny spurs. This, however, is no reason not to grow asparagus ferns, simply wear gloves during asparagus fern care.</li>\r\\n  <li>Asparagus fern can provide small flowers and berries when it is happy in its location. Berries can be planted to propagate the asparagus fern plant. Medium green, cascading foliage that will quickly fill a container can be expected when growing asparagus fern.</li>\r\\n  <li>Growing asparagus fern indoors takes a little more effort. Humidity is necessary and indoor areas are often dry because of winter heat. Mist the plant daily and provide a nearby pebble tray to keep the tiny leaves from turning brown and dropping. The fern may dry out to the point it appears dead; however, outdoor springtime temperatures generally revive them.</li>\r\\n  <li>Keep well watered in all situations and repot every few years. Care of asparagus ferns indoors involves misting the arching stems to provide humidity to the plant. When you grow asparagus ferns outside in summer, asparagus fern care involves watering, fertilizing to encourage growth and occasionally pruning out dead stems.

Maranta have some of the most beautiful, most decorative leaves in the plant kingdom. The popular M. tricolour has deep green, velvety leaves with yellow splotches down the midrib and arching red veins travelling to the leaf margins. They are fairly common as houseplants, but not necessarily easy to keep growing over the long-term. They require plenty of warmth and humidity and are susceptible to a number of pests. That said, however, some people have more luck with Maranta species than with the closely related Calathea, which also feature beautiful leaves but can be a bit more temperamental. In terms of display, Maranta is all fairly low-growing plants, with none reaching over about 8 inches tall, making them excellent for grouped displays of low plants on a windowsill.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Growing Conditions</strong>\r\\n<strong>Light:</strong> Maranta dislikes direct sunlight. If exposed to direct light, their leaves will fade in colour intensity and often develop blotches or patches. In the winter, when the plants go into dormancy (and sometimes die back completely), give them bright light to maintain growth.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Water:</strong> During the growth season, water frequently and never allows potting soil to dry out. They are very susceptible to drought. However, to avoid fungal problems, try not to get water directly on the leaves or let it sit.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Soil:?</strong>A rich, peat-based potting soil with excellent drainage is beneficial.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Fertilizer:</strong>?Feed with a weak liquid fertilizer throughout the growing season. Cut fertilizer back to once a month or so in the winter.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Propagation</strong>\r\\nSome Maranta species can be propagated by leaf cuttings or rhizome division. The most common (and easiest) way to propagate Maranta is by division at repotting. When repotting, simply divide the plant into half and pot up each half in a fresh pot. Keep new divisions very warm and moist during the first few weeks until new growth emerges.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Repotting</strong>\r\\nMaranta are not necessarily fast-growing plants and even healthy specimens likely only need to be repotted every other year. During repotting, gently remove the plant from its old container, shake roots clean, and place it into a new container with fresh potting soil. Divide the plant during repotting to increase your stock. Repot in the spring, before the growing season starts.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Varieties</strong>\r\\nThere are many varieties of Maranta, but the most popular by far is the tricolour variation that pops up in garden centres. Alternatively, the Maranta and Calathea plants are so closely associated with one another that it\'s not uncommon to see labelling errors.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Grower\'s Tips</strong>\r\\nA well-grown Maranta should have full, six-inch-long leaves rising from a short centre stem and draping down. They are strikingly beautiful plants. They thrive best with provided with greenhouse-like conditions: warm, moist, gentle airflow, and plenty of fertilizer. Plants that are kept too cool or too dry are likely to lose their leaves or suffer from fungal infections that will cause the plant to die from root rot or collapse. Plants that are exposed to too much sun are likely to become washed out and develop brown blotches on their leaves. These plants, with their fleshy and thick leaves, are prime targets for pests (in my experience) and frequently seem to have problems with mealybugs, aphids, and mites. Signs of infestation include tiny webs on plants, clumps of white \"powdery\" residue, or visible insects on the plant. Treat infestations as soon as possible to prevent them from spreading to the rest of your collection. As always, start with the least toxic treatment option first, only progressing to more serious chemicals if your initial efforts fail.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '199', 'Calathea Triostar, Marantha Triostar - Maranta, Stromanthe Sanguinea, tricolour', '', '', '', '', '', 'calathea-triostar-stromanthe-triostar', ''),

Be sure to let the soil dry out at least half an inch (1 cm.) or so between waterings. In winter, cut back watering to about once monthly. Occasionally, you may find that pruning becomes necessary as part of your string of pearls care to maintain its size or appearance. This is simple to do. Trim off any dead stems and pearls, as well as any stems that have lost a lot of their ?beads.? Pruning back will help promote fuller, more compact plants.

They have light-green foliage with the new leaves opening up in bright orange color. Its foliage tends to get more coarse with age and its leaves more prominently ribbed. The stiff, dark red leaf stems hold the large leaves upright. New leaves unfurl a vivid orange and change to pale green when mature.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Growing Requirements for Philodendron Plants</strong>\r\\nMost Philodendrons are native to the jungles of tropical America, and as such, prefer the medium light intensity they would have on the jungle floor. They will tolerate low light, but if there is too little light, the new leaves will develop smaller, and farther apart on the stem.\r\\nOn the other hand, direct sunlight will burn the foliage, and stunt the growth of the plant. Keep the soil evenly moist, but allow it to dry out between waterings. Keep Philodendrons slightly drier during the winter months, when the growth slows.\r\\nOverwatering will cause the leaves to turn yellow. Underwatering will cause the leaves to turn brown and fall off.\r\\n\r\\nFeed your Philodendron in the spring and again in mid-summer with a liquid house plant fertilizer. The ideal growing temperature is between 75 and 85 degrees F. during the day and in the 60\'s at night. Philodendron Plants will survive for a short time in temperatures as low as 36 degrees F. Wash the leaves regularly to prevent the pores from becoming plugged with dust.\r\\n\r\\nPhilodendrons will tolerate the level of humidity found in most homes, but high humidity promotes lush growth and shiny foliage, so it is a good idea to mist the plant regularly.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Repotting Philodendron Plants</strong>\r\\nPhilodendrons grow best when their roots are slightly cramped, (but not too cramped), so don\'t plant them in a pot that is too large. When the roots begin to compact into a tight ball, the plant should be repotted into a planter that is 2-3 inches larger. Repotting should be done in late winter or spring before the plant begins active new growth. Good drainage is essential, so if there are no drainage holes, be sure to fill the bottom of the pot with clean stones or broken crockery.\r\\n\r\\nUse a good commercial potting soil or a mixture consisting of equal parts of loam, sand, and peat moss, with some chopped charcoal, gravel, broken crocks, or brick added. Newly potted plants need to be carefully watered during the first month or so, to be certain that the roots don\'t dry out completely. Never allow the soil to become saturated or soggy. It\'s especially helpful to mist the leaves of newly planted Philodendrons two or three times a day.\r\\n\r\\nIt is also a good idea to add a moss stake or other type of pole to the planter at the time of repotting if this is a climbing or vining type of Philodendron. As the plant grows, it will need some sort of support. The are several types of plant poles available at garden centers. Some types of Philodendrons produce aerial roots which will cling to whatever support they find.\r\\n\r\\nThese roots should never be cut off completely, but they can be trimmed back if they become too long, or begin to die back. It is far better to attach these roots to the support pole, or lead them back to the pot where they can grow into the soil.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '199', 'Philodendron, philodendron orange prince, prince of orange', '', '', '', '', '', 'philodendron-prince-of-orange', ''),

It is native to the Mediterranean and Asia but is reasonably hardy in cool climates. It can withstand droughts, surviving a severe lack of water for lengthy periods. Its seeds are often difficult to start, with a low germination rate and relatively slow growth, hence it\'s recommended to buy the Plant, the plant itself can live as long as 30 years.<sup id=\"cite_ref-cabi_3-3\" class=\"reference\"></sup>\r\\n<h3>Plant Care</h3>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Keep the plant in natural indirect bright Light.</li>\r\\n  <li>Poke your finger/plain small stick into the soil to check the moisture.</li>\r\\n  <li>Water when topsoil (1-2inches) feels dry to touch.</li>\r\\n  <li>Re-pot after 20-25 days of receiving the plant.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\nIt\'s easy to care for the Rosemary plant. When growing these plants, provide them with well-drained, sandy soil and at least six to eight hours of sunlight. These plants thrive in warm, humid environments and cannot take extremely cold temperatures. Since rosemary cannot withstand winters below 30 F. (-1 C.), it?s often better when growing rosemary plants to put them in containers, which can be placed in the ground and easily moved indoors during winter.\r\\n<h3>Placement</h3>\r\\nRosemary prefers to remain somewhat on the dry side; therefore, terra cotta pots are a good choice when selecting suitable containers. These pots allow the plant to dry out faster. Thoroughly water rosemary plants when the soil is dry to the touch but allow the plants to dry out between watering intervals. Even indoors, rosemary plants will require lots of light, for at least six hours, so place the plant in a suitable location like a South facing window, with a good amount of filtered light.\r\\n\r\\n<b>Medicinal Use:</b>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Laboratory studies have shown rosemary to be rich in antioxidants, which play an important role in neutralizing harmful particles called free radicals</li>\r\\n  <li>Blood levels of a <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/rosemary-oil-benefits\">rosemary oil</a> component correlate with improved cognitive performance, according to research in Therapeutic Advances in Psychopharmacology, published by SAGE</li>\r\\n  <li>this plant contains an ingredient, carnosic acid, that is able to fight off free radical damage in the brain</li>\r\\n  <li>This plant may have the potential to prevent brain aging.</li>\r\\n  <li>Rosemary may be an effective herbal anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor agent</li>\r\\n  <li>Note- Please consults your health advisor before applying or consuming plants or plant parts.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n<b>Culinary Use:</b>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>While rosemary blends well with other herbs, use it lightly on its own in lamb, pork, chicken, and veal dishes, as well as in soups and stews, vegetables, and sauces</li>\r\\n  <li>Rosemary provides a wonderful flavour in bread and makes a good marinade with olive oil, wine, and garlic</li>\r\\n  <li>Rosemary\'s aromatic qualities also enhance a bath, bouquet, wreath, or sachet</li>\r\\n  <li>Note- Please consults your health advisor before application or consuming of plants or plant parts</li>\r\\n</ul>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '275', 'anthos, blue flower, fragrant, herbal plants, herbs, kitchen plants, rosemary, Rosmarinus officinalis, Salvia rosmarinus', '', '', '', '', '', 'rosemary-plant-salvia-rosmarinus-officinalis-kitchen-herbs', ''),

If they aren?t kept at this temperature they will begin to drop their leaves.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n<strong>Water requirements</strong>\r\\nCrotons need to have their soil evenly moist at all times, they tend to wilt easily if the soil is too dry. On the other hand, if the soil is too wet the leaves will turn brown on the edges. These plants also prefer to have a location with higher humidity. It is generally recommended that they be placed somewhere with a humidity of 40-80%. If the humidity isn?t high enough the plants will drop some of their leaves and the colour of the leaves may not be as vibrant.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Common problems</strong>\r\\nThe most common problem that people experience with crotons is spider mites. If the humidity is too low this tends to make them very susceptible to spider mites. The best way to get rid of the pests is to apply a miticide and mist them daily.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Sunlight</strong>\r\\nPlant crotons where they will receive direct sunlight for at least six to eight hours a day. They can grow as tall as 6 feet and up to 3 feet wide with enough light. Their green leaves turn to shades of yellow, red and purple throughout the year, showing their brightest colours in the sun in cooler months.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Weather Conditions</strong>\r\\nCrotons are evergreen plants and will continue to grow throughout winter when they show off their colours. Crotons grow best at between 60 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Lower night or seasonal temperatures will not harm the plants, as they are hardy enough to withstand temperatures as low as 40 F. However, it is wise to cover a bed of crotons or bring potted ones indoors if a frost is expected. The plants can tolerate heat as high as 100 F but should have some shade in areas that experience severe heat.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Water</strong>\r\\nWell-drained soil works best for growing crotons outdoors so the soil can dry between waterings. Pots should provide good drainage, as well. Water the plants when the top of the soil is dry. On especially hot days, you may need to water the crotons twice a day. Crotons like humid weather, and misting the plants throughout the hottest days of summer will help the leaves stay bright and healthy.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Fertilizer</strong>\r\\nOutdoor crotons require fertilizer with a recommended ratio of 3-1-2 (3 per cent nitrogen, 1 per cent phosphorus and 2 per cent potassium). Liquid or gradual-release granular fertilizer work well, using amounts listed on the packaging. Too much fertilizer can damage the roots and cause the leaves to be dull instead of bright and shiny.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Pests</strong>\r\\nAlthough crotons are generally pest-free, they can be affected by a few garden pests. Mealybugs are a type of scale insect that show up as white cottony masses. Mites are eight-legged insects that cause the leaves to become curled or speckled. Thrips are commonly called \"greenhouse thrips,\" and often attack newly developed plants. They leave scarred or calloused spots where they feed. These pests can be treated with a pesticide developed for tropical plants or houseplants.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '549', '599', 'Codiaeum, codieaum variegatum, Duckfoot croton, Golden Petra, leopard plant, Little white soldier, spotted leaf drimiopsis, Tishul Croton', '', '', '', '', '', 'variegated-duck-foot-croton-plant', ''),

Not to be confused with the rather similar looking Calathea lancifolia, the Calathea Rufibarba is also often referred to as the ?velvet calathea? or ?furry feather Calathea? on account of its fluffy feather-shaped leaves.\r\\n\r\\nThe Maranta genus includes a few dozen low-growing plants native to the American tropics. Maranta have some of the most beautiful, most decorative leaves in the plant kingdom. The popular M. tricolour has deep green, velvety leaves with yellow splotches down the midrib and arching red veins travelling to the leaf margins. They are fairly common as houseplants, but not necessarily easy to keep growing over the long term. They require plenty of warmth and humidity and are susceptible to several pests. That said, however, some people have more luck with Maranta species than with the closely related Calathea, which also feature beautiful leaves but can be a bit more temperamental. Maranta are all fairly low-growing plants in terms of display, with none reaching over about 8 inches tall, making them excellent for grouped displays of low plants on a windowsill.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Growing Conditions</strong>\r\\n<strong>Light:</strong> Maranta dislikes direct sunlight. If exposed to direct light, their leaves will fade in colour intensity and often develop blotches or patches. In the winter, when the plants go into dormancy (and sometimes die back completely), give them bright light to maintain growth.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Water:</strong> During the growth season, water frequently and never allows potting soil to dry out. They are very susceptible to drought. However, to avoid fungal problems, try not to get water directly on the leaves or let them sit.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Soil:?</strong>A rich, peat-based potting soil with excellent drainage is beneficial.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Fertilizer:</strong>?Feed with a weak liquid fertilizer throughout the growing season. Cut fertilizer back to once a month or so in the winter.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Propagation</strong>\r\\nSome Maranta species can be propagated by leaf cuttings or rhizome division. The most common (and easiest) way to propagate Maranta is by division at repotting. When repotting, simply divide the plant in half and pot up each half in a fresh pot. Keep new divisions very warm and moist during the first few weeks until new growth emerges.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Repotting</strong>\r\\nMaranta are not necessarily fast-growing plants and even healthy specimens likely only need to be repotted every other year. During repotting, gently remove the plant from its old container, shake roots clean, and place it into a new container with fresh potting soil. Divide the plant during repotting to increase your stock. Repot in the spring, before the growing season starts.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Varieties</strong>\r\\nThere are many varieties of Maranta, but the most popular by far is the tricolour variation that pops up in garden centres. Alternatively, the Maranta and Calathea plants are so closely associated with one another that it\'s not uncommon to see labelling errors.\r\\n<h2><span id=\"Calathea_Rufibarba_Plant_Care_Watering_Guide\">Calathea Rufibarba Plant Care & Watering Guide</span></h2>\r\\n<h3><span id=\"Watering_your_Rufibarba_Plant\">Watering your Rufibarba Plant</span></h3>\r\\nCalatheas like to be damp at all times and, unlike philodendrons, don?t enjoy drying out in-between waterings. With this being said, one of the most common causes of plant death is root rot and so it?s worth noting that the plant likes to have its feet moist, but not sitting in water.\r\\n\r\\nOne of the biggest problems plant lovers face when caring for their calathea plants is browning leaf edges. This is particularly common in cultivars such as the Calathea Orbifolia, though much less common in the Calathea Rufibarba.\r\\n\r\\nIf brown tips occur, it likely means that your plant is receiving the wrong kind of minerals in the water it is being given. To combat this, I typically allow water to sit in a jar for several days before using it to water my plants. Alternatively, you could try using rainwater.\r\\n\r\\nAnother common reason for brown tips is the lack of humidity. This can be solved by keeping your calathea plant in a bathroom or kitchen (provided that they still have adequate light) or grouping some of your calathea plants in an arrangement.

There are about 100 different individual species, and most species then have a large number of hybrids and cultivars, with flower styles varying significantly from the original.\r\\n\r\\nThe actual heliconia flower is fairly insignificant. What most people would call the \'flower\' is actually a group of colourful specialised leaves, called bracts. The true flowers are hidden inside these bracts.\r\\n\r\\nHeliconia leaves look more or less like banana leaves. They are generally green, but some are tinged slightly with colour (particularly when young) and sometimes the leaves and stems are coloured or patterned slightly.? Some foliage is wildly coloured, however, particularly in Heliconia indica cultivars.\r\\n\r\\nHeliconias grow from an underground system of rhizomes. Rhizomes are a type of root (the ginger that you buy in the supermarket is a piece of rhizome from the common edible ginger plant). There are pictures of heliconia rhizomes below, under \'Rhizomes\'.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Where and how to grow heliconias</strong>\r\\nMost heliconia species do not tolerate cold weather and will suffer injury when temperatures fall below 13C. The general climatic conditions required for healthy growth are warm and humid.\r\\n\r\\nAll of the eastern coast of Queensland, northern stretches of New South Wales, and most areas of humid Northern Territory and Western Australia are perfect for heliconia growing - the only requirement is a selection of the right cultivars.\r\\n\r\\nZones 10-12 are excellent for heliconias. Zone 9 is fine for all except the ultra tropical species. Zone 8 will support cold tolerant heliconias if they are looked after and provided the right microclimate. See the Zone Hardiness Map page to check your Zone.\r\\n\r\\nMost varieties of heliconias will grow well in full sun, whereas others require partial shade. They tend to grow taller if grown in shadier areas.\r\\n\r\\nHeliconias prefer freely draining soils with high organic matter. They are heavy feeders and they need lots of water. They are best grown on slopes or raised beds for good drainage and they need plenty of space.\r\\n\r\\nHeavy mulching is recommended to protect the soil from drying out and to enhance the soil\'s organic matter. Additional irrigation is important for low rainfall areas.\r\\n\r\\nFertilisers used by home gardeners are generally chicken pellets, although complete fertilizer blends are ideal. The only significant pests for gardeners are grasshoppers, scale and mealybugs. Diseases are rare but wet feet, especially in winter, can rot the root system.\r\\n\r\\nYou should not prune your heliconias, as the \'stem\' is actually made up of rolled leaf bases and the flowers emerge from the top of these \'pseudostems\'. However, each stem will only flower once, so after flowering, you can cut that stem out. This is recommended, to encourage more flowering, to increase airflow in between the stems of your plant, and also to generally tidy it up and improve the appearance.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Rhizomes</strong>\r\\nHeliconias may be propagated by division of rhizomes or from seeds, although dividing rhizomes is by far the most common method. Heliconias are seldom grown from seeds. Not all species set seeds, seeds may take up to a year to germinate, and germination percentages may be poor. The seedlings that do come may not be the same as the parent plant.\r\\n\r\\nDividing rhizomes guarantees an identical plant to the parent. Propagating heliconias by division involves making a cut across a section of rhizome (ideally bearing at least one visible sucker). The cut section of the rhizome can then be transplanted to a new location. The planted rhizomes usually sprout within two months.\r\\n\r\\nThe size and weight of Heliconia rhizomes vary depending on the species or variety. Smaller species, such as psittacorum rhizomes, may weigh only 50 to 70g. Rhizomes of large Heliconias like caribaea varieties may weigh 300g to 700g and more.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '550', '650', 'heliconia lady diana, Heliconia Psittacorum', '', '', '', '', '', 'heliconia-lady-diana-orange-heliconia-psittacorum', ''),

When your plant arrives, put it in a cool room and set it in a window that receives bright light but little or no direct sun. Flowers will open and last longer with cooler home temperatures.\r\\n\r\\nJasmines are also sensitive to the dryness created by radiators, hot-air vents, and wood-burning stoves. The best way to increase the humidity around your plants is to run a humidifier nearby. You can also set plants in trays filled with pebbles or gravel. Add water to a level just below the tops of the pebbles (if the potting mix in the pots comes in contact with the water, the mix will draw water into the pot, which will cause the mix to become saturated, eventually leading to rot). Refill trays frequently to replace water lost through evaporation. (Our Humiditrays perform the same function without the need for pebbles.)\r\\n<h4>Water</h4>\r\\nWater only when the top half-inch of the potting mix is dry to the touch; Jasmine won\'t tolerate soggy potting mix. If these conditions are met, flowering generally begins in late January or early February.\r\\n\r\\nAfter bloom, give your plant at least 6 hours of direct sun and normal room temperatures. When the danger of frost has passed, we recommend that you set the plant outdoors for the summer, shifting it gradually from a shady spot to full sun. Fertilize every 2-4 weeks during the growing season -- generally from early spring to early fall. Withhold fertilizer entirely during fall and winter, when the plant is resting. Use a water-soluble fertilizer designed for houseplants mixed at just half the rate suggested by the manufacturer. As with watering, plants suffer if overfertilized.\r\\n\r\\nPrune as necessary to control size or to maintain shape, but stop pruning by August 1, because the plant sets flower buds in late summer.To encourage the formation of flower buds for next winter, be sure your plant experiences the cooler temperatures and shorter days of early autumn. The plant needs 4-5 weeks of nighttime temperatures between 40? and 50?F, plenty of sunlight, and the complete absence of artificial light after sundown. Bring the plant indoors before frost. Then give it cool temperatures and indirect light until it blooms again in late winter.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '199', 'Indian Jasmine, Juhi Plant, yellow jasmine', '', '', '', '', '', 'yellow-jui-plant-juhi-indian-jasmine-jasminum-molle', ''),

Named after the famous Brazilian artist and landscape designer ? Roberto Burle Marxii, it truly is a piece of art that will be a great addition to any space.\r\\n\r\\nThe Maranta genus includes a few dozen low-growing plants native to the American tropics. Maranta have some of the most beautiful, most decorative leaves in the plant kingdom. The popular M. tricolour has deep green, velvety leaves with yellow splotches down the midrib and arching red veins travelling to the leaf margins. They are fairly common as houseplants, but not necessarily easy to keep growing over the long term. They require plenty of warmth and humidity and are susceptible to a number of pests. That said, however, some people have more luck with Maranta species than with the closely related Calathea, which also feature beautiful leaves but can be a bit more temperamental. In terms of display, Maranta is all fairly low-growing plants, with none reaching over about 8 inches tall, making them excellent for grouped displays of low plants on a windowsill.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Growing Conditions</strong>\r\\n<strong>Light:</strong> Maranta dislikes direct sunlight. If exposed to direct light, their leaves will fade in colour intensity and often develop blotches or patches. In the winter, when the plants go into dormancy (and sometimes die back completely), give them bright light to maintain growth.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Water:</strong> During the growth season, water frequently and never allows potting soil to dry out. They are very susceptible to drought. However, to avoid fungal problems, try not to get water directly on the leaves or let them sit.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Soil:?</strong>A rich, peat-based potting soil with excellent drainage is beneficial.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Fertilizer:</strong>?Feed with a weak liquid fertilizer throughout the growing season. Cut fertilizer back to once a month or so in the winter.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Propagation</strong>\r\\nSome Maranta species can be propagated by leaf cuttings or rhizome division. The most common (and easiest) way to propagate Maranta is by division at repotting. When repotting, simply divide the plant in half and pot up each half in a fresh pot. Keep new divisions very warm and moist during the first few weeks until new growth emerges.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Repotting</strong>\r\\nMaranta are not necessarily fast-growing plants and even healthy specimens likely only need to be repotted every other year. During repotting, gently remove the plant from its old container, shake roots clean, and place it into a new container with fresh potting soil. Divide the plant during repotting to increase your stock. Re-pot in the spring, before the growing season starts.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Varieties</strong>\r\\nThere are many varieties of Maranta, but the most popular by far is the tricolour variation that pops up in garden centres. Alternatively, the Maranta and Calathea plants are so closely associated with one another that it\'s not uncommon to see labelling errors.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Grower\'s Tips</strong>\r\\nA well-grown Maranta should have full, six-inch-long leaves rising from a short centre stem and draping down. They are strikingly beautiful plants. They thrive best with provided with greenhouse-like conditions: warm, moist, gentle airflow, and plenty of fertilizer. Plants that are kept too cool or too dry are likely to lose their leaves or suffer from fungal infections that will cause the plant to die from root rot or collapse. Plants that are exposed to too much sun are likely to become washed out and develop brown blotches on their leaves. These plants, with their fleshy and thick leaves, are prime targets for pests (in my experience) and frequently seem to have problems with mealybugs, aphids, and mites. Signs of infestation include tiny webs on plants, clumps of white \"powdery\" residue, or visible insects on the plant. Treat infestations as soon as possible to prevent them from spreading to the rest of your collection. As always, start with the least toxic treatment option first, only progressing to more serious chemicals if your initial efforts fail.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '475', '500', 'Calathea Ctenanthe Burle Marxii, Marantha Burle Marxii, Wishbone Prayer plant', '', '', '', '', '', 'calathea-burle-marxii-fishbone-prayer-plant', ''),

Keep reading to learn more about Mandevilla care.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Tips for Mandevilla Care</strong>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>When you buy your Mandevilla vine, chances are that it?s a lush plant full of flowers. You may wish to transplant it to the ground or into a bigger or more decorative container. Mandevilla flowers need sandy, well-draining soil with plenty of organic material mixed in with it. A good soil mix for Mandevilla plants includes 2 parts peat moss or potting soil to 1 part builder?s sand.</li>\r\\n  <li>An important part of Mandevilla care is the kind of light they receive. Mandevilla vines need some shade. They enjoy bright, indirect light or filtered sunlight, but can get burned in direct, full sunlight.</li>\r\\n  <li>In order to get the best Mandevilla flowers throughout the summer, give your Mandevilla plant a high phosphorus, water-soluble fertilizer once every two weeks. This will keep your Mandevilla vine blooming wonderfully.</li>\r\\n  <li>You may also want to pinch your Mandevilla. This method of pruning your Mandevilla will create a bushier and fuller plant. To pinch your Mandevilla vine, simply use your fingers to pinch off 1/4 ? 1/2 inch off the end of each stem.</li>\r\\n  <li>Mandevilla\'s are vines and they will need some kind of support in order to grow as best they can. Be sure to provide a trellis or some other support for your Mandevilla vine to grow up.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n<strong>Growing Mandevilla Year Round</strong>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>The Mandevilla plant is often thought of as an annual but, in fact, it is a very frost tender perennial. Once temperatures go below 50 degrees F., you can bring your Mandevilla plant indoors for the winter.</li>\r\\n  <li>When you bring your Mandevilla flowers indoors, be sure to check the plant carefully for pests and treat these pests before bringing the plant indoors. You may want to cut back the plant by up to 1/3.</li>\r\\n  <li>Once indoors, place your Mandevilla vine in a place where it will get bright, indirect light. Water the plant when the soil is dry to the touch.</li>\r\\n  <li>In the spring, when the temperatures are consistently above 50 F., remove any dead leaves and move your Mandevilla plant back outside to enjoy another summer.</li>\r\\n</ul>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '199', 'Rocktrumpet, white Mandevilla', '', '', '', '', '', 'mandevilla-plant-rocktrumpet-multicolour', ''),

It eliminates mainly Benzene, Formaldehyde & gives fresh Oxygen. It is a natural humidifier.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Growing Conditions</strong>\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Light:</strong>?The darker green varieties can grow in near shade, while the variegated varieties require brighter light. Do not expose to direct sun.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Water:</strong> Water thoroughly in the summer, and mist often to raise humidity. During the winter, reduce watering but do not let the plant dry completely. Seek to raise the humidity in general.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Temperature:</strong>?They do not like cold drafts or temperatures below 65?F. The warmer, the better.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Soil:</strong>?A well-drained potting soil is perfect.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Fertilizer:</strong>?Slow-release pellets or liquid fertilizer during the growing season.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Propagation:</strong>?Aglaonema are not typically propagated by home growers, but they can be divided during repotting.

The A. commutatum in widely available, in both the Silver Spear (variegated) form and a green form. A pure green A. modestum is seen more rarely. Beware the fruit of the A. crispum, which are toxic. Other variegated forms include A. pictum, A. silver queen (almost totally silver), and A. pseudobracteatum.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Grower\'s Tips</strong>\r\\nBecause of their high humidity requirements, some growers consider aglaonema to be greenhouse plants. It\'s true they will do best in the warm, humid and bright environment of a greenhouse, but they can successfully be grown indoors by coming as close as possible to these conditions. The number one rule to remember with aglaonema is this: keep them warm and moist.

Wood apples look like small coconuts, averaging 5 to 12 centimetres in diameter, and have a hard, woody, white-light brown shell with a rough consistency similar to tree bark and Wood apples are available in the late summer through winter or post-monsoon season in Asia.\r\\n\r\\nThe rind also has a small hole at the top of the <a href=\"https://nurserynisarga.in/product-category/fruits/\">fruit</a> where it was once connected to the tree, also where it emits a pungent, buttery aroma often likened to blue cheese. It is nearly impossible to determine the ripeness of the fruit just by appearance alone. To test for maturity, the fruit is dropped on the ground from a height of about one foot, and if the fruit bounces, it is not ripe.\r\\n\r\\nThe pulp or flesh of the Wood apple is ivory when immature, transitioning into orange-brown or dark brown with age.

Because this fruit has so many virtues. An apple is beautiful, tasty, and has a fine fragrance. It is cultivated worldwide as a fruit tree and originated in Central Asia. Apples can grow anywhere, excluding extremely hot or extremely cold climates. On the outside, it is a colourful fruit. It comes in various colours from green to red to gold. In taste, an apple is tasty and juicy and has various tastes from sour to sweet. One can eat an apple raw, cooked, or baked, and it can be used in various dishes.\r\\n\r\\nHEALTH BENEFITS OF APPLE\r\\nApples are very good for one?s health. An English saying is AN APPLE A DAY KEEPS THE DOCTOR AWAY. An apple is good for one?s digestion, and also has important vitamins and minerals. Apples also help to clean one?s teeth after a meal. Good for Weight Loss and good for your heart. Substances in apples may help prevent cancer. Apples contain compounds that can help fight asthma. The antioxidants in apples may help protect your brain in old age.\r\\n\r\\nMAINTENANCE OF THE PLANTATION\r\\nOnce a plantation has been established, the work should not be considered finished. It will be necessary, for example, to protect the plantation against weather, fire, insects and fungi, and animals. A variety of cultural treatments also may be required to meet the purpose of the plantation.\r\\n\r\\nFERTILIZING\r\\nGenerally, no manures or fertilizers are applied to the rain-fed crops. However, a fully grown tree recommends the following dose for early and bumper harvest with a good keeping quality. Bio meal 10 kg, 5:10:5 1 Kg. Ormichem micronutrient mixture 0.250 kg at the time of flowering and another dose of 10:26:26 or 19: 19: 19 mixture after fruit set. Foliar spray with 8:12:24:4 10 gm/lt, twice during fruit development. Occasionally, zinc or iron or both deficiencies are noticed and can be taken care of by spraying chealed zinc or Ferrous.\r\\n\r\\nWATERING AND WEED CONTROL\r\\nYoung apple trees should be watered regularly until fully established. In dry western climates, water mature trees deeply at least every one or two weeks. Desert gardeners may have to water more frequently. Mulch the soil around the trees to conserve moisture. Weeding is also very important. Remove all weeds 1.5 meters around the plant.\r\\n\r\\nPRUNING AND TRAINING\r\\nAs the trees mature they will only need light pruning in late August ? September. In mid-summer tip prune and remove the two leaves at the end of the branch. This will promote fruiting wood.\r\\n\r\\nPEST & DISEASE FOR APPLE TREES\r\\nEvery fruit tree has the future potential for disease and insect damage. Factors such as location and weather will play a part in which issues your tree encounters. If available, disease-resistant trees are the best option for easy care; and for all trees, proper maintenance (such as watering, fertilizing, pruning, spraying, weeding, and fall cleanup) can help keep most insects and diseases at bay.\r\\n\r\\nHARVESTING YOUR APPLES\r\\nThe apples should be picked when mature, yet hard, with mature skin colour but a hard flesh. Gently remove the apples from the tree, keeping the stem intact. Sort through the apple harvest and remove any apples that have insect erosion.\r\\n\r\\nPLANTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\\n1. Prioritize your tree planting with the sun?s direction to maximize shade by planting on the southwestern and western sides of your home\r\\n2. Apple trees can grow in a wide range of soils from medium-textured clays to gravelly sands. However, poor soils will produce poor results and the best crops are found on fertile sandy soils and loams.\r\\n3. For Commercial Plantation, the average number of plants in an area of one ha. can range between 200 to 1250. Four different categories of planting density are followed viz. low (less than 250 plants/ha.) moderate (250-500 plants/ha.), high (500-1250 plants/ha.) and ultra high density (more than 1250 plants /ha.). The combination of rootstock and scion variety determines the plant spacing and planting density/unit area.\r\\n4. In a home garden, generally we are planting one or two apple trees and other fruit plants species. So it is better to keep a minimum of 3 meters distance from other plants to plant an apple tree.\r\\n5. 100% sunlight is best but can grow up to 50 % shade\r\\n6. During dry weather, initially water the plant once in two days and after one month of planting water every 7 to 10 days during the first year.\r\\n7. Do not use chemical fertilizer or any other chemicals on your newly planted trees. Such products will kill your young trees. If needed you can add chemical fertilizers in small quantities (generally below 100gm) after two to three months of planting with sufficient irrigation.\r\\n8. Do not overwater or allow rainwater so much that you see standing water in the pit area of the plant. It will damage the plant?s roots and results in the die of your plant.\r\\n<table xss=removed width=\"568\">\r\\n<tbody>\r\\n<tr>\r\\n<td>Propagation Method</td>\r\\n<td>Grafting</td>\r\\n</tr>\r\\n<tr>\r\\n<td>Blooming Season</td>\r\\n<td>April to May</td>\r\\n</tr>\r\\n<tr>\r\\n<td>Maturity Duration</td>\r\\n<td>2 to 3.5 years</td>\r\\n</tr>\r\\n<tr>\r\\n<td>Plant Age</td>\r\\n<td>1 years (Matured)</td>\r\\n</tr>\r\\n</tbody>\r\\n</table>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '800', 'apple, apple plant, hot climate apple', '', '', '', '', '', 'grafted-apple-fruit-plant-hot-climate-variety', ''),

There are many different species of Philodendrons, each possessing its own characteristics as to leaf size, shape or colouring. Some species climb while others remain in more of a shrub shape.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Growing Requirements for Philodendron Selloum Plants</strong>\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Light</strong>\r\\n\r\\nMost Philodendrons are native to the jungles of tropical America, and as such, prefer the medium light intensity they would have on the jungle floor. They will tolerate low light, but if there is too little light, the new leaves will develop smaller, and farther apart on the stem.\r\\nOn the other hand, direct sunlight will burn the foliage, and stunt the growth of the plant.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Watering</strong>\r\\n\r\\nKeep the soil evenly moist, but allow it to dry out between waterings. Keep Philodendrons slightly drier during the winter months, when the growth slows.\r\\nOverwatering will cause the leaves to turn yellow. Underwatering will cause the leaves to turn brown and fall off.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Fertilizer</strong>\r\\n\r\\nFeed your Philodendron in the spring and again in mid-summer with a liquid house plant fertilizer. The ideal growing temperature is between 75 and 85 degrees F. during the day and in the 60\'s at night. Philodendron Plants will survive for a short time in temperatures as low as 36 degrees F. Wash the leaves regularly to prevent the pores from becoming plugged with dust.\r\\n\r\\nPhilodendrons will tolerate the level of humidity found in most homes, but high humidity promotes lush growth and shiny foliage, so it is a good idea to mist the plant regularly.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Repotting Philodendron Plants</strong>\r\\n\r\\nPhilodendrons grow best when their roots are slightly cramped, (but not too cramped), so don\'t plant them in a pot that is too large. When the roots begin to compact into a tight ball, the plant should be repotted into a planter that is 2-3 inches larger. Repotting should be done in late winter or spring before the plant begins active new growth. Good drainage is essential, so if there are no drainage holes, be sure to fill the bottom of the pot with clean stones or broken crockery.\r\\n\r\\nUse a good commercial potting soil or a mixture consisting of equal parts of loam, sand and peat moss, with some chopped charcoal, gravel, broken crocks or brick added. Newly potted plants need to be carefully watered during the first month or so, to be certain that the roots don\'t dry out completely. Never allow the soil to become saturated or soggy. It\'s especially helpful to mist the leaves of newly planted Philodendrons two or three times a day.\r\\n\r\\nIt is also a good idea to add a moss stake or other type of pole to the planter at the time of repotting if this is a climbing or vining type of Philodendron. As the plant grows, it will need some sort of support. The are several types of plant poles available at garden centres. Some types of Philodendrons produce aerial roots which will cling to whatever support they find.\r\\n\r\\nThese roots should never be cut off completely, but they can be trimmed back if they become too long, or begin to die back. It is far better to attach these roots to the support pole, or lead them back to the pot where they can grow into the soil.\r\\n\r\\n<b>PRO TIP:</b> Hope Selloum\'s long stems will bend toward sunlight, so rotate the plant frequently to keep it looking its fullest.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '599', '650', 'Philodendron bipinnatifidum, selloum, Thaumatophyllum bipinnatifidum, the hope selloum, Tree philodendron', '', '', '', '', '', 'philodendron-selloum-hope-selloum-bipinnatifidum', ''),

When you learn how to care for a dieffenbachia plant, you?ll find it to be adaptable to different kinds of lighting and conditions in which you might not expect a dieffenbachia houseplant to grow.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>How to Care for a Dieffenbachia Plant</strong>\r\\nProblems with dieffenbachia plant can be easily overcome in most situations. The most common problem with growing dumbcane dieffenbachia is too much moisture. Overwatering is a common problem with many houseplants and the dieffenbachia houseplant is no exception. Plant the dumbcane in well-draining soil and water lightly, keeping the soil consistently moist, but not soggy. Check the soil to make sure it is dry an inch down before watering the dieffenbachia plant.\r\\n\r\\nOther problems with the dieffenbachia plant may be created by improper lighting. When growing dieffenbachia, most varieties do best in a filtered light situation, where bright to moderate light shines through a sheer curtain or other filtering window cover. Filtered light is particularly important in the spring and summer when the dieffenbachia houseplant is producing new, tender leaves that are subject to sunburn if the light is too bright or shines directly on the plant.\r\\n\r\\nRotate the dieffenbachia houseplant regularly to provide adequate light to all sides of the plant and prevent it from reaching toward the light on one side. When growing dumb cane dieffenbachia of various cultivars, check light requirements for the particular plant. Some dieffenbachia plants require low filtered light. Most cultivars do fine with a low light environment; however, growth is slower or stops, but the plant will remain healthy and attractive.\r\\n\r\\nWhen growing dumbcane dieffenbachia, fertilize twice a month to encourage growth and a healthy plant. A houseplant food high in nitrogen can be applied at half strength.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Dieffenbachia Houseplant Problems</strong>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Browning\'s bottom leaves on the dumbcane dieffenbachia is normal for the plant, snip them off to keep the plant tidy.</li>\r\\n  <li>If other leaves appear bleached, with a webby substance?on the underside, check and treat the plant for spider mites with insecticidal soap spray or neem oil. Don?t use chemicals for this issue on the growing dumbcane dieffenbachia, as it often makes the problem worse.</li>\r\\n  <li>If you notice water droplets on the dumbcane plant, you may wonder ?why does my dieffenbachia plant drip water?? This is the byproduct of the transpiration process, which is active in most plants.</li>\r\\n  <li>It?s also important to note that the leaves, if chewed or eaten, can cause temporary swelling of the tongue and throat, leading to a temporary loss of speech and the common plant name of dumbcane. While this is usually not serious, it can cause suffocation. Avoid placing the dumbcane plant where curious children or pets might be tempted to taste it.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n<strong>Watering and Feeding</strong>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Being from the aroid family ? with cousins like the Aglaonema, Spathiphyllum and Philodendron ? let us know dieffenbachia likes humidity and during the summer lots of water. Soil stays moist but not wet. During the winter season watering should be reduced.</li>\r\\n  <li>During the primary growing season ? March Through October ? feed every other week when watering using a complete liquid food. During the winter months use NO fertilizer and water only.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n<strong>Soil, Potting and Transplanting</strong>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Dieffenbachia prefers well-draining soil. I?ve had excellent results using 2 parts peat moss and 1 part perlite. An African violet soil mix would work well also.</li>\r\\n  <li>A large plant like ?Tropic Snow? capable of reaching 4-5 feet can be grown and live in a relatively small pot. The problem is usually not pot size but plant size making the plant top-heavy.</li>\r\\n  <li>For top-heavy plants use a cachepot to stabilize the top-heavy plant</li>\r\\n  <li>When potting or repotting plants, springtime is best just before the growing season begins.

Those dark-green leaves are 2 ft (60 cm) long and up to 4 inches (10 cm) wide. The plant will always look full and profuse. Grown for their attractive foliage, dracaenas are popular plants that need very little care. There are over 100 species of dracaena trees and succulent shrubs, although many are used as houseplants because they\'re easy to grow and tolerate low light. These tropicals, which are in the Dracaena genus and the asparagus family, are great for adding structure to outdoor gardens, too. In cold regions, they\'re treated as annuals. According to research conducted by NASA, dracaenas can clean benzene, carbon dioxide, formaldehyde, and trichloroethylene from indoor air. However, they\'re toxic to companion animals like dogs and cats and should be kept out of their reach.\r\\n<h4>Dracaena Care Tips</h4>\r\\nIf you?re wondering how to care for dracaena, we?ve got you covered with these growing tips. In general, dracaena care is relatively simple.\r\\n<h4><b>Light</b></h4>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Filtered indoor light (such as through a sheer curtain in front of a sunny window) or a semi-shade spot is an ideal location. Never place a dracaena plant in direct sun, as the rays will scorch its foliage.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n<h4>Water</h4>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Dracaena require less water than most indoor plants. Keep them hydrated by misting the leaves with water and keeping the soil lightly misted (never soggy) as well with good drainage. Always allow the topsoil to dry out before watering. Do not overwater, as it may cause root rot. Drooping or yellowing leaves could indicate over-watering or poor drainage, but don?t worry if you notice the bottom leaves beginning to turn yellow and fall. It is normal for dracaena to shed leaves in order to grow new ones. These plants are sensitive to fluoride, which can be found in tap water, so it?s essential to use purified water when caring for this plant. Leaves with dark brown and dead areas with yellow edges may indicate fluoride toxicity.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n<h4><b>Temperatures</b></h4>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Dracaena prefers temperatures ranging from 65 ? 78? during the day. Night temperatures can drop about ten degrees cooler, but cold drafts and temperatures below 55? will harm the plant. Make sure that you display your dracaena away from any heating or cooling appliances. Natural room humidity is fine seeing as the dracaena is such a hardy houseplant, but it does prefer the higher humidity of its natural rainforest habitat. You can improve humidity with a commercial humidifier or by placing the plant on a tray of pebbles, with water reaching just below the pebble tops.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n<h4><b>Toxicity</b></h4>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Toxic to cats and dogs, if eaten. Cats may have dilated pupils, and both cats and dogs can present symptoms such as vomiting, excess saliva, and lack of appetite. As a pet owner, it?s important to select your houseplants with care.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n<h4><b>Pests and Problems</b></h4>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Dracaena plants are generally free from serious insect or disease problems. However, you should watch out for mealybugs, spider mites, and scale. Mealybugs and scale can both be treated with an insecticide that contains pyrethrin.</li>\r\\n</ul>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '499', 'Dracaena, Dracaena Plant', '', '', '', '', '', 'dracaena-plant', ''),

Do not allow the leaves to be exposed to too much direct sun, because the leaves can scorch easily, leaving big brown spots or even holes in the leaves. Northern or eastern windows work well.

They need to stay evenly moist in well-draining soil, and they have more trouble bouncing back from underwatering or overwatering than other tropicals. But they certainly can bounce back! A great way to ensure that you are watering your alocasia the right amount is to wait for the top inch or half-inch of the soil to become dry to the touch. Do not wait for the soil to completely dry out, you need to keep the soil moist. Too much water is also bad and could cause root rot if the soil is soggy. If the leaves of your Alocasia Polly have turned yellow, it is probably one of these two watering issues. A humidity tray can help create the humid environment Alocasia Polly prefers.

To improve a basic potting soil mix, you can blend it with peat moss for moisture retention and nutrients and perlite or coarse sand to create more drainage. Even though Alocasia Polly likes even moisture and cannot sit in soggy soil so it is important that your soil drains adequately. Letting the soil dry a little bit before watering should help ensure even moisture. Otherwise, they do not have any pH requirements and a well balanced potting soil should do well.

Their leaves can be either dark green or variegated. In recent years, some imaginative nurseries have started to take advantage of their pliable trunks to braid or twist the plants into different forms.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Light:</strong>?They need a bright room, even with a little direct sun in the morning. In their native habitat, they are often grown in semi-shady conditions, but indoors they need good light to thrive.\r\\n<strong>Water:</strong>?Keep steadily moist, but don\'t allow it to sit in water or it will drop leaves and suffer from root rot.\r\\n<strong>Soil:</strong>?Any good, fast-draining potting soil will likely do.\r\\n<strong>Fertilizer:</strong>?These are heavy feeders and need plenty of fertilizer throughout the growing season.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Propagation</strong>\r\\nFicus Lyrata can be relatively easy rooted from cuttings, even without rooting hormone. It\'s best to take a cutting in the spring when you can more easily supply warmth and moisture. Ficus is rarely grown from seed and most indoor plants will never fruit or yield seed.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Repotting</strong>\r\\nA healthy ficus is a fast-growing plant and will need careful attention paid to its potting. First off, if you notice your plant is growing more slowly, it\'s probably because of low water or low temperatures. The repotting requirements also depend on how you\'re growing the plant: ficus are incredibly flexible. They can be grown as standards, topiary, braided standards, regular houseplants, and even bonsai. Take your cues from the plant and repot annually in many circumstances.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Grower\'s Tips</strong>\r\\nFicus Lyrata is a wonderful and incredibly rewarding plant to grow indoors. They make beautiful corner plants and large indoor \"trees\" for entryways and foyers. Although it is a little more challenging, it is possible to overwinter F. benjamina in temperate areas without massive leaf-dropping, but it will require careful attention to watering and temperature. In general, make sure to aggressively fertilizer your ficus plant, especially during the growing season. They have a fairly high need for fertilizer. Also, make sure to prune away dead branches and pick dead leaves to prevent the spread of diseases or fungal infections that can severely affect your plant. If your plant is dropping leaves despite all these steps, and you\'re giving it nice bright light, try supplementing with a little magnesium and manganese. Ficus Benjamina is vulnerable to pests including aphids, mealy bugs, scale, and whitefly. If possible, identify the infestation as early as possible and treat it with the least toxic option.\r\\n\r\\nFicus Lyrata is one of the most popular houseplants in the world. Known as the weeping fig, the F. Benjamina is native to India and Southeast Asia, where its an important fruit and landscape plant. One of the common complaints about F. Benjamina is its tendency to shed leaves easily: you move it, it drops leaves; the watering schedule changes, it drops leaves. It might help to know that part of this is because of the way these plants have evolved. F. Benjamina is native to the subtropics and tropics where there is a distinct wet and dry season. In their native environment, plants typically drop leaves at the beginning of the dry season, making them exquisitely sensitive to changes in moisture. In terms of indoor culture, they are not especially demanding, but dislike being moved and, as mentioned before, they are highly sensitive to changes in watering.\r\\n<div id=\"shopify-section-product-plant-care\" class=\"shopify-section\"><section class=\"product-plant-care\" data-section-id=\"product-plant-care\" data-section-type=\"product-plant-care\">\r\\n<div class=\"grid-x grid-padding-x grid-padding-y\">\r\\n<div class=\"cell\">\r\\n<h3 class=\"section-title\">Plant Care</h3>\r\\n</div>\r\\n<div class=\"cell medium-4\">\r\\n<div class=\"grid-x grid-padding-x grid-padding-y\">\r\\n<div class=\"cell small-3 medium-12 large-2\"><img class=\"section-image\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0150/6262/t/110/assets/pdp-plant-care-icon_full-sun.png?v=6595913712348405148\" alt=\"Light Tip\" width=\"68\" height=\"63\"></div>\r\\n<div class=\"cell small-9 medium-12 large-10\">\r\\n<h4 class=\"plant-care-title\">Light</h4>\r\\n<p class=\"section-content\">Thrives in bright indirect light to full sun.

This unusual gem of a plant features deep green leaves so deep that they almost appear black. The silvery-white veins make an attractive contrast against the dark leaves and the undersides feature a splotchy magenta colour. The shape of the leaves is also unique as it resembles an ovate heart. When mature, the plant reaches about one to two feet in height.\r\\n<h4>Care for Alocasia plant</h4>\r\\n<strong>Sunlight:</strong>\r\\n\r\\nAlocasias need bright, but indirect light. This is due to the plant\'s natural habitat, on the forest floor beneath the tree canopy. Direct sun will cause the leaves to burn, so avoid placing your Alocasia in a spot where it\'ll be exposed to the sun for a prolonged period. This plant is not tolerant of lower light conditions though, so make sure the space you\'re placing yours in feels very bright\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Water:</strong>\r\\n\r\\nAlocasia prefers to sit in soil that is consistently and evenly moist. Allow the top 2-3\" to dry between watering to ensure the plant isn\'t sitting in soil that is too wet. During the winter, Alocasias will go through a dormancy period and will require less frequent watering as the soil will take longer to dry. Alocasias can be susceptible to root rot and fungal infections if their soil doesn\'t have proper drainage and becomes waterlogged, so we always advise potting these plants in a vessel with a drainage hole.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Fertilizer:</strong>\r\\n\r\\nDuring spring and summer, the Alocasia Black Velvet will benefit from fertilizing once monthly. This plant isn?t a heavy feeder, so we recommend giving a diluted dose of any basic houseplant fertilizer (dilute or cut back to at least half the recommended amount). Again, too much isn?t a good thing and can cause other issues. And once fall approaches, you?ll want to stop supplementing with fertilizer as many houseplants, including the Black Velvet, will enter a semi-dormant stage. You?ll discontinue fertilizer (and any other stressful event that requires the plant to work) through the winter.\r\\n\r\\n<b><i>Repotting:</i></b>\r\\n\r\\nAlocasia Black Velvet will benefit from repotting. Not only will this allow room for the roots to continually grow, but fresh soil can rejuvenate the plant. You?ll need well-draining soil that also allows for high aeration since these roots want to breathe. In addition, only go up in size by roughly 1-2 inches in diameter. Too much room at once isn?t favourable and does not support the plant?s ability to grow.\r\\n\r\\nPay attention to the condition of your Alocasia and its watering needs and you will have a long and happy relationship.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '620', '750', 'Alocasia, Alocasia Black Velvet Plant, Alocasia Reginula, Black Velvet Plant', '', '', '', '', '', 'alocasia-black-velvet-plant-alocasia-reginula', ''),

The trunk is very low to subterranean in young plants but lengthens above ground with age. It can grow into very old specimens with 6?7 m (over 20 feet) of the trunk; however, that produces multiple heads of beautiful leaves.\r\\n\r\\nIt is a tropical and sub-tropical showy evergreen that is related to conifers but looks more like a palm. The Sago Palm is very slow-growing and may take up to 50 or more years to reach 10 feet tall. It is frequently cultivated as a houseplant. The leaves grow from the trunk. They are shiny,?palm-like, and have spiny tips and the?margins of the leaves?roll downward.\r\\n\r\\nSago Palm and Emperor Sago are closely related. Sago Palm has a leaf span of about 6 feet and brown stem color; whereas Emperor Sago has a leaf span of 10 feet with?stems that are reddish-brown and leaflet margins are flat. It is also?thought to be slightly more cold weather?tolerant.? Both of these plants are?dioecious which means there must be a male and female plant to reproduce. They reproduce by using exposed seeds (gymnosperm), much like pines and fir trees. Both plants have a palm-like appearance, but they are not true palms. They do not flower, but they?produce cones much like conifers.\r\\n\r\\nThe plant is native to the Japanese Island of Kyusha, the Ryukyu Islands, ad southern China. They are found in thickets along hillsides.\r\\n\r\\n \r\\n\r\\n</div>\r\\n<h3>Sago Palm Basic Information</h3>\r\\n<strong>Common Name: </strong>Sago Palm.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Difficulty:</strong> Medium.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Fertilizer: </strong>Feed monthly spring through fall with a liquid fertilizer (such as 18-6-18) diluted by half. Only fertilize when watering to avoid fertilizer burn. A slow-release fertilizer also works well, but I only use half the amount recommended on the package. The leaves will shrivel and dry up when it has been over-fed.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Height: </strong>Up to 6 ft (1.8 m) indoors. Can be kept dwarfed by growing it in a small pot. Sago Palm is also popularly grown as a bonsai tree.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Soil: </strong>Cactus mix works well. Or combine 2 parts peat-moss-based potting mix and 1 part sharp sand or perlite.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Sunlight: </strong>Bright light with some direct sun. Turn the pot a quarter turn at least once a week during the growing season. Otherwise, the plant will lean toward the light source.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Temperature: </strong>Temperature: Average room temperatures of 65?F (16?C) - 75?F (24?C) are suitable and no lower than 55?F (12.7?C).\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Water: </strong>Take care to water the soil, not the crown of the plant which can lead to crown rot and may kill the plant. Water thoroughly and allow the soil to dry out a bit between watering, but don t allow it to dry out completely. Waterless in winter. Provide good drainage.\r\\n<h3><b><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">Planting and Care</span></b></h3>\r\\n<span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\"><strong>Sago palms</strong> are very slow-growing plants that take a fair few years to reach their maximum height of approximately 2ft when grown indoors.

Do not expose to direct sun.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Water:</strong>?Water thoroughly in the summer, and mist often to raise humidity. During the winter, reduce watering but do not let the plant dry completely.

Its two best-known members, pineapples and Spanish moss, give an idea of the diversity of this group of plants. Most bromeliads are easy to grow either indoors or in the greenhouse. They have attractive forms and leaf colors, and many with flowers that can last for months. The showy bromeliad may look difficult to grow but it can easily adapt to average home conditions with its astonishing array of colors and textures. Although many do have very splashy flower displays, bromeliads are just as popular as beautiful foliage plants with leaves in red, green, purple, orange, and yellow colors and with bands, stripes, spots, and other features. Bromeliads are relatively slow-growing plants that take one to three years to mature into flowering plants.\r\\n<h3>Bromeliad Plant Growing Tips</h3>\r\\n<p role=\"heading\">(Following a few simple steps can keep you enjoying bromeliads, both indoors and outdoors, for several seasons)</p>\r\\n\r\\n<div class=\"RqBzHd\">\r\\n<ul class=\"X5LH0c\">\r\\n  <li class=\"TrT0Xe\">Provide bright light without direct sun exposure.</li>\r\\n  <li class=\"TrT0Xe\">Maintain optimal humidity.</li>\r\\n  <li class=\"TrT0Xe\">Keep air flowing around the plants.</li>\r\\n  <li class=\"TrT0Xe\">Make sure the plants stay moist but not soggy.</li>\r\\n  <li class=\"TrT0Xe\">Provide adequate drainage.</li>\r\\n  <li class=\"TrT0Xe\">Fertilize sparingly.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n<h3>Bromeliad Plant Care Tips</h3>\r\\nBromeliad plants require a different type of care,?it\'s pretty easy and doable even for beginners. Don\'t panic because we\'ve got you covered on how to care for your Bromeliad plant. From sunlight requirement to common problems and their solutions.\r\\n<h4>Sunlight</h4>\r\\nFirst, on our list on how to care for your Bromeliad plant is to put it in a bright, sunny space where it can get bright, indirect light. They can also thrive in low light conditions, which makes them great low light indoor plants, as well. Avoid placing your Bromeliad plant under direct sunlight as this can burn the leaves. Generally, if you have a Bromeliad plant with hard or stiff leaves, it will most likely enjoy bright, indirect light. While a Bromeliad plant with soft, flexible leaves will prefer lower lighting levels.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Common Problem:</strong>?If the leaves of your Bromeliad plant are producing brown or white patches, it could mean that the plant is receiving too much light.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Solution:</strong>?Your Bromeliad plant will grow best under bright, indirect light. A Bromeliad plant that has been receiving too much light will have bleached (white patches ) or sunburned (brown patches) leaves.\r\\n<h4>Water</h4>\r\\nNext on our list on how to care for your Bromeliad plant is to water it once a week since they are very tolerant of drought conditions. It?s important to keep the soil moist, but not soggy. Avoid overwatering your plant to avoid root rot.\r\\n\r\\nThere are two ways you can water your Bromeliad plant:\r\\n<ol>\r\\n  <li>Keep the central cup filled with water, particularly if the light levels and temperature are high. Be sure to remove the water from the central cup every so often to remove any built-up salts.</li>\r\\n  <li>Water your plant through the soil weekly during the growing season.</li>\r\\n</ol>\r\\n<strong>Common Problem:</strong> Overwatering your plant can cause severe damage, such as root rot.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Solution:</strong>?The best way to avoid this problem is to follow a watering schedule of once a week. It\'s much better to underwater your plant since it\'s fixable than to overwater it.\r\\n\r\\nYour plant can be sensitive to salts in tap water, so it?s best to use distilled water or a water filtration system. However, if this is not possible, leave the water in an open container overnight.\r\\n<h4>Humidity & Temperature</h4>\r\\nAdding to our list on how to care for your plant is to put it in a room with a relative humidity of 40 to 60%. To increase the humidity in your home, we suggest that you mist it often, place it near a humidifier, or use a pebble tray. Avoid placing your plant near air conditioning vents, doors, and drafty areas, as well.\r\\n\r\\nAlso, your plant prefers temperatures between 70?75?F during the day and between 60?65?F at night.\r\\n<h4>Toxicity</h4>\r\\nYour Bromeliad plant is non-toxic to children and pets.\r\\n<h4>Pests & Other Problems</h4>\r\\nBromeliad plants are prone to common pests, such as mealybugs. To eliminate this pest, use a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol. You can also use horticultural oil, organic insecticidal soap, or organic neem oil.\r\\n\r\\n</div>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '349', 'Bromeliad, Bromeliad Plant', '', '', '', '', '', 'bromeliad-plant-white', ''),

Indoors, the plants will do quite well at room temperature, though they prefer a cooler indoor climate. Outdoors, leatherleaf ferns grow best in partial to full shade but inside will take bright, indirect light. Never grow these ferns in direct sunlight.\r\\n<h3>Soil and Water</h3>\r\\nAlthough leatherleaf ferns have moderate drought tolerance, you should not allow them to dry out. During periods of drought, water the ferns to maintain a continuous low level of moisture. During the cooler parts of the year, periodic rains should be enough. Never water leatherleaf ferns with water that is salty or contains a high mineral concentration, as they will not tolerate it. Leatherleaf ferns will grow in clay, sand, or loam soil, and prefer acidic media.\r\\n<h3>Garden Uses</h3>\r\\nLeatherleaf ferns make good understory plants or ground covers planted beneath taller shrubs or trees. Because they\'re so wide, you should plant the ferns with their centres 18 to 24 inches apart for a thick, leafy ground cover. You can also use leatherleaf ferns to form a border in larger garden areas. In cooler climates, grow them in pots indoors or in a greenhouse.

Calathea has some of the most beautiful, most decorative leaves in the plant kingdom. The popular M. tricolour has deep green, velvety leaves with yellow splotches down the midrib and arching red veins travelling to the leaf margins. They are fairly common as houseplants, but not necessarily easy to keep growing over the long term.\r\\n<h4><strong>Requirement </strong></h4>\r\\nThey require plenty of warmth and humidity and are susceptible to a number of pests. That said, however, some people have more luck with Maranta species than with the closely related Calathea, which also feature beautiful leaves but can be a bit more temperamental. In terms of display, Calathea Roseopicta \"Medallion\" is all fairly low-growing plants, with none reaching over about 8 inches tall, making them excellent for grouped displays of low plants on a windowsill.\r\\n<h4><strong>Growing Conditions: </strong><strong>Light</strong></h4>\r\\nCalatheas dislikes direct sunlight. If exposed to direct light, their leaves will fade in colour intensity and often develop blotches or patches. In the winter, when the plants go into dormancy (and sometimes die back completely), give them bright light to maintain growth.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Water:</strong> During the growth season, water frequently and never allows potting soil to dry out. They are very susceptible to drought. However, to avoid fungal problems, try not to get water directly on the leaves or let them sit.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Soil:?</strong>A rich, peat-based potting soil with excellent drainage is beneficial.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Fertilizer:</strong>?Feed with a weak liquid fertilizer throughout the growing season. Cut fertilizer back to once a month or so in the winter.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Propagation: </strong>Some Calathea (Maranta) species can be propagated by leaf cuttings or rhizome division. The most common (and easiest) way to propagate Maranta is by division at repotting. When repotting, simply divide the plant in half and pot up each half in a fresh pot. Keep new divisions very warm and moist during the first few weeks until new growth emerges.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Repotting: </strong>Calathea is not necessarily a fast-growing plant and even healthy specimens likely only need to be repotted every other year. During repotting, gently remove the plant from its old container, shake roots clean, and place it into a new container with fresh potting soil. Divide the plant during repotting to increase your stock. Report in the spring, before the growing season starts.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Varieties: </strong>There are many varieties of Calatheas, but the most popular by far is the tricolour variation that pops up in garden centres.\r\\n<h4><strong>Grower\'s Tips</strong></h4>\r\\nA well-grown Calathea should have full, six-inch-long leaves rising from a short centre stem and draping down. They are strikingly beautiful plants. They thrive best with provided with greenhouse-like conditions: warm, moist, gentle airflow, and plenty of fertilizer.\r\\n<h4><strong>My Experience</strong></h4>\r\\nThese plants, with their fleshy and thick leaves, are prime targets for pests (in my experience) and frequently seem to have problems with mealybugs, aphids, and mites. Signs of infestation include tiny webs on plants, clumps of white \"powdery\" residue, or visible insects on the plant. Treat infestations as soon as possible to prevent them from spreading to the rest of your collection.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '650', '800', 'Calathea Marion, Marantha Medallion Plant', '', '', '', '', '', 'calathea-roseopicta-medallion-plant', ''),

It is also the southern U.S. answer to the peony. Similarities between peonies and camellias include lushly petaled blooms and a tendency to live for more than a century. They live so long because they grow slowly.\r\\n\r\\nCamellias are part of the Theaceae or tea plant<em>?</em>family, including the most common ornamental species, which yields flowers that?produce tea, but it is not as ornamental. They can be planted anytime except for the hottest summer months.\r\\n<h3 id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-8\" class=\"comp u-how-to-title-align mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading\"><span class=\"mntl-sc-block-heading__text\">Camellia Care</span></h3>\r\\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-9\" class=\"comp text-passage u-how-to-title-align mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\">Camellias are best planted in rich, moist soil in a part-shade location, When you are planting your camellia, install it slightly higher than the surrounding soil. This allows excess water to drain away from the center of the plant. Don?t plant this shrub where it will have competition for nutrients. For example, don?t plant it beneath a tree with shallow roots, like a birch.</p>\r\\n\r\\n<h3><strong>Plant Care Instructions</strong></h3>\r\\n<div id=\"care\">\r\\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-16\" class=\"comp u-how-to-title-align mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading\"><strong><span class=\"mntl-sc-block-subheading__text\">Light: </span></strong><span class=\"mntl-sc-block-subheading__text\">All camellias need some protection from the hot afternoon sun as young plants. However, plants that receive no sun will struggle to flower. Morning sun and dappled afternoon shade are ideal.?</span></p>\r\\n<p class=\"bold\"><strong>Soil:</strong> Should be well-drained with a pH of 6 to 6.5 (slightly acid). Keep it moist.</p>\r\\n<p class=\"bold\"><strong>Water:</strong> Water regularly for the first couple of years, then keep the soil moist, but not too wet. Provide summer water in dry climates.</p>\r\\n<p class=\"bold\"><strong>Pruning:</strong> Pruning is rarely needed, but it helps to remove crossover limbs or diseased/deadwood. This can be done after blooming has finished in spring.</p>\r\\n<p class=\"bold\"><strong>Exposure:</strong> Part shade to full shade. Most prefer dappled light, but a few varieties need (or tolerate) more sun than others. In general, red-flowered varieties can withstand more sun than white varieties.</p>\r\\n<strong>Diseases/Pests:</strong> For pests, natural products are available, such as neem oil. Camellia petal blight affects flowers and buds, turning them into an unsightly brown. Dispose of flowers in the garbage; do not compost, as composting will likely spread the fungal spores.\r\\n<h3 id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-47\" class=\"comp u-how-to-title-align mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading\"><span class=\"mntl-sc-block-heading__text\">Potting or Repotting</span></h3>\r\\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-48\" class=\"comp text-passage u-how-to-title-align mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\">Once the seeds have germinated, transplant into containers or outside.

Then reduce watering to once a week. Azaleas need to stay moist, not wet or dry. Generally an inch of water a week is sufficient when it is hot and dry.? azaleas can never be left to fend for themselves as they are too shallow-rooted to survive. Watering in the winter is sometimes necessary. Too much water is just as bad for azaleas as too little.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Fertilizing:</strong> Azaleas are light feeders and require only a small amount of fertilizer to maintain good foliage color and flowers. You only have to apply it once a year in a very small quantity. Or use one of the combination insecticide-fertilizer products if you have lace-bug problems. Because always water well after each application of fertilizer. If you use too much, you could easily burn up your plants. Do not use any kind of fresh manure on azaleas.

Provide bright indirect light and keep the soil slightly moist when watering. It grows best at a temperature between 64-79?F (18-26?C). 60% or more humidity is best for the plant to thrive. Fertilize once a week using a liquid fertilizer during the growing season,\r\\n<h4><strong>Size & Growth</strong></h4>\r\\nPhilodendron Burle Marx is a small-sized plant, and the maximum height it can usually reach is only two feet. Regarding the width, it grows between two and four feet.\r\\n<h4>Sunlight</h4>\r\\nBurle Marx likes bright places but he doesn?t like direct sunlight. It is best to place it near a window with bright-coloured curtains where the light will be bright but defused.\r\\n<h4><span id=\"Watering\"><strong><b>Watering</b></strong></span></h4>\r\\nWatering a Philodendron plant is much like watering most Philodendron plants. You want to keep the soil moist. You don?t want to drench the soil in water and you don?t want it to dry out. Over-watering your Philodendron is as dangerous as under-watering it.\r\\n<h4>Useful Tip</h4>\r\\nWhen you over-water, your plant is susceptible to different diseases. This includes the horrible root rot we discussed earlier. But root rot isn?t the only horrible condition your plant can go through. The other conditions are only a little better when it comes to planting damage. The only exception is during winter. When the cold months hit, you can let all the soil dry out before you water the Philodendron.\r\\n<h4><span id=\"Soil\"><strong><b>Soil</b></strong></span></h4>\r\\nThe best soil for Philodendron is 100% peat moss or a mix of 200% peat and perlite. For a plant, you need well-draining soil. This type of soil ensures excess water drains through the plant pot. This prevents all that extra water from building up in the soil.\r\\n<h4>Temperature</h4>\r\\nPhilodendron Burle Marx likes moderate room temperatures, from 60 to 75 degrees F.

They are really easy to grow inside. Just keep the tree outside until the temperature drops below 50, and then place it near a sunny window indoors. As a bonus, you?ll get to enjoy the fresh, summery fragrance of the winter harvest in your home. On average, fruit-bearing begins when the trees are between 3 and 6 years old; however, exact timing will depend on the type of citrus (lemons, oranges, grapefruit, etc.), the cultivar, your climate, the health of the plant and its care, and other factors. <a href=\"https://nurserynisarga.in/product-category/flowering/\">Flowering</a> is not seasonal but occurs during warm weather and regular rainfall.</p>\r\\n\r\\n<h3>Planting</h3>\r\\nAlways get the planting area ready beforehand, amending the soil if necessary. Choosing a suitable location is also important. For instance, when planting a grapefruit tree, an area on the southernmost side of the home not only offers the most sun but also provides optimal winter protection. Keep the tree at least 12 feet (4 m.) from buildings, walks, driveways, etc. This will allow for adequate growth. Grapefruit trees can be planted in spring or fall, depending on where you?re located and what works best for you and your region?s conditions. Keep in mind that those planted in spring must contend with the heat of summer while fall-planted trees must endure the hardships of unseasonably cold winters. Dig the planting hole both wide and deep enough to accommodate the roots. After placing the tree in the hole, backfill halfway with soil, firmly pressing down to squeeze out any air bubbles. Then water the soil and allow it to settle before backfilling with the remaining soil. Keep the soil level with the surrounding area.\r\\n<h3>Care</h3>\r\\nPlanting your grapefruit tree correctly is the first step of your care regime. Bountiful trees will require consistent attention to ensure they stay happy and healthy. The best way to care for a grapefruit tree is to equip yourself with the knowledge to be mindful of its needs. Below, we?ll look at how to care for this evergreen citrus tree.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Water:</strong> You need to water your grapefruit plant thoroughly once to three times per week for the first year after planting. In the summer, in particular, it will require a deep water session as soon as the topsoil layer becomes dry.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Fertilizing: </strong>As is the case with most citrus trees, you should feed your grapefruit plants every month or so during their growing season and less frequently during the colder seasons. With that being said, it also depends on the overall health of your trees. A lush, thriving grapefruit tree that is budding and producing fruit likely doesn?t need additional nutrients and is receiving enough sustenance from the ground and water.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Soil: </strong>As a growing medium, garden soil provides a substrate that not only anchors plants but also allows the transport of water and nutrients to the plant\'s roots. The pore spaces between soil particles facilitate aeration, resulting in increased or decreased airflow around the roots, a vital contributor to plant health. But each type of soil varies in its composition, texture and water-retention ability. Because all plants don\'t thrive in all types of garden soil.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '549', '599', 'chakotara, Citrus Pomelo, grapefruit', '', '', '', '', '', 'grapefruit-plant', ''),

These verbena-like flowers have long since been admired for their extended bloom time.\r\\n\r\\nThere are several varieties available that offer a multitude of colours. Depending on the region and type grown, lantana plants can be treated as annuals or perennials. Grow lantana flowers in the garden or in containers. Trailing varieties can even be grown in hanging baskets. Lantanas also make a great choice for those wishing to attract butterflies and hummingbirds to the garden.\r\\n<h4><strong>How to Grow Lantana Flowers</strong></h4>\r\\nGrowing lantana in the garden is a great way to add colour and interest. Simply choose a sunny location and plant them in well-draining soil. Although these plants are tolerant of many soil conditions, lantana flowers prefer slightly acidic soil. Mulching with pine needles is an easy way to raise pH levels in areas with low acid.\r\\n\r\\nLantanas are planted in spring once the threat of cold weather and frost have ceased. Keep in mind, however, that they prefer warm temperatures so new growth may be slow to appear. Once the temperatures warm up though, they will grow abundantly.\r\\n<h4><strong>Caring for Lantana Plants</strong></h4>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>While newly planted lantanas require frequent watering, once established, these plants require little maintenance and are even tolerant of somewhat dry conditions. In fact, a good soaking about once a week should keep them relatively happy.</li>\r\\n  <li>Although it isn?t required, lantana plants can be given a light dose of fertilizer each spring, but too much may inhibit their overall flowering.</li>\r\\n  <li>To encourage reblooming, cut the tips (deadhead) periodically.

They\'re ideal as border plants, as hedging, or in a container.\r\\n<div class=\"crm_product_ld\">\r\\n\r\\nBottle Brush Plant is a genus of shrubs in the family Myrtaceae and was first described as a genus in 1814. The entire genus is endemic to Australia but widely cultivated in many other regions and naturalized in scattered locations.\r\\n\r\\n</div>\r\\nAs a frost tolerant and woody plant, bottlebrushes are attractive options for home gardeners. Since they also tolerate drought and damp conditions well, they are showcased throughout landscaped lawns and gardens all over the world. And the flower spikes are red in colour and full of texture, and the leaves of some bottlebrush varieties are ornamental as well. The average lifespan for bottlebrushes is twenty to forty years because they promise beauty and blooms for many years. Although the woody shrub is low maintenance, proper care can help to ensure it continues blooming to its fullest each year.\r\\n\r\\nBottlebrush plants get their name from the spikes of flowers that bloom at the ends of the stems and bear a strong resemblance to a bottle brush. And also grow them as shrubs or small trees that grow up to 15 feet. Because most bottlebrush varieties bloom over a long summer season in shades of red or crimson.\r\\n<h5>How to Grow a Bottlebrush</h5>\r\\nBottlebrush <a href=\"https://nurserynisarga.in/product-category/outdoorplant/\">Outdoors</a>, plant bottlebrush shrubs in a sunny location. Because the plants aren?t picky about the soil type as long as it is well-drained. But if the soil is very poor, enrich with compost at planting time. Once established, bottlebrush plants tolerate drought and moderate salt spray. And bottlebrush care consists of regular watering while the tree is young and annual fertilization until it matures. And also water young trees weekly in the absence of rain, applying the water slowly to saturate the soil as deeply as possible. Because a layer of mulch over the root zone will slow the evaporation of water and help prevent weeds. And also use a 2-inch (5 cm.) layer of shredded hardwood or bark or a 3 to 4 inch (8 to 10 cm.) layer of light mulch such as pine straw, hay or shredded leaves.\r\\n<h5>Bottle Brush Special Feature</h5>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Plant in clumps, mass or naturalize in a lightly-shaded woodland setting, native plant garden and naturalized area.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n<h5>Bottle Brush Uses</h5>\r\\n<div>\r\\n\r\\n<b>Ornamental Use:</b>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>The plant is used for ornamental purposes.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n<b>Medicinal Use:</b>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n</div>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '599', '699', 'Bottle Brush Plant, Callistemon, Melaleuca Flammea, Red Cascade, Weeping Bottle Brush', '', '', '', '', '', 'bottle-brush-plant', ''),

No other plant on earth gives so much. Food, drink, oil, fuel, weaving, rope, lumber, wine, mulch, candles, darts, and bowls are just a few of the uses of this incredible plant.\r\\n<h5><strong>Growing Tips</strong></h5>\r\\nIf you want to start to grow a coconut plant, begin with a fresh coconut that still has the husk on it. When you shake it, it still should sound like it has water in it. Soak it in water for 2-3 days.\r\\n\r\\nAfter the coconut has been soaked, place it in a container filled with well-draining potting soil. It is best to mix in a little sand or vermiculite to make sure the soil you will be growing coconut trees in drains well. The container needs to be around 12 inches deep to allow for the roots to grow properly. Plant the coconut point side down and leave 1/3 of the coconut above the soil.\r\\n\r\\nAfter planting the coconut, move the container to a well lit, warm spot. The warmer the better. Coconuts do best in spots that are 70 degrees F. (21 C.) or warmer.\r\\n\r\\nThe trick to growing a coconut palm tree is to keep the coconut well-watered during germination without letting it sit in overly wet soil. So, water the coconut frequently but make sure the container drains very well.\r\\n\r\\nYou should see the seedling appear in 3-6 months.\r\\n\r\\nIf you want to plant a coconut that has already sprouted, go ahead and plant it in well-draining soil so that the bottom 2/3 of the coconut is in the soil. Place in a warm area and water frequently.\r\\n<h5>How to Keep it Healthy</h5>\r\\nOnce your coconut tree has started growing, you need to do a few things to help keep it healthy.\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>First, water the coconut tree frequently. As long as the soil drains well, you really can?t water them too often. If you decide to repot your coconut tree, remember to add sand or vermiculite to the new soil to keep the water draining well.</li>\r\\n  <li>Second, growing coconut palms are heavy feeders. They will need regular and complete fertilizer. Look for a fertilizer that provides both the basic nutrients plus trace nutrients like boron, manganese and magnesium.</li>\r\\n  <li>Third, coconut palms are very cold sensitive. If you live in an area that gets cold, your coconut plant will need to come inside for the winter. Provide supplemental light and keep it away from drafts. In the summer, grow it <a href=\"https://nurserynisarga.in/product-category/outdoorplant/\">outdoors</a> and make sure you place it in a very sunny and warm spot.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n<h5>Special Feature</h5>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Rock gardens, border fronts, edgings, fragrance gardens and containers ?

The short compact shape of an Emerald Gem Plant makes it ideal for areas with height restrictions. Emerald Gem Plants are usually 12?-30? in height when sold in the stores. Although an Emerald Gem Plant is a relative of the easy-care Philodendron, it is a lot more finicky and requires more attention. However, if you are tired of the same old houseplants, a Homalomena or Emerald gem Plant makes a nice addition to your plant collection.\r\\n<h6><strong>LIGHTING REQUIREMENTS</strong></h6>\r\\nA Homalomena Plant requires medium indirect light but grows even better in bright indirect light. Homalomenas can survive in low light but become thin and spindly. The bottom leaves of an Emerald Gem Plant turn yellow and fall off when there is not enough light.\r\\n<h6><strong>CARE INSTRUCTIONS WATER</strong></h6>\r\\nWatering is the most difficult part of caring for an Emerald Gem Plant. When an Emerald Gem Plant is either over or watered the bottom leaves fall off. Always allow the top 50% of the soil of an Emerald Gem Plant to dry out before watering. An Emerald Gem Plant doesn?t like anything cold, so use warm water and never dump extra ice cubes into the soil.\r\\n<h6><strong>FERTILIZER</strong></h6>\r\\nFeed an Emerald Gem Plant monthly in the spring and summer when the plant is actively growing with a basic houseplant food at 1/2 the recommended strength. In the fall and winter fertilize an Emerald Gem Plant every other month if the plant is producing new leaves.\r\\n<h6><strong>TEMPERATURE</strong></h6>\r\\nEmerald Gem Plants like warm household temperatures between 65-80 degrees.

So let the potting mix dry out slightly between watering.\r\\n\r\\nThis plant does best in average room temperatures of 65 to 75 F. Keep the leaves away from cold windows, air conditioners, and heat sources. Because palms are sensitive to low temperatures so if you place them outside during the summer be sure to bring them in before temperatures dip below 50 degrees.

They are herbaceous perennial vines growing to around four metres tall, with a large, woody caudex. The leaves are arranged spirally on the stem, and are peltate, with the leaf petiole attached near the centre of the leaf. The name Stephania comes from the Greek, \"a crown\". This refers to the anthers being arranged in a crown-like manner.\r\\n\r\\nThis is a stunning and unusual plant, perfect for window or desk display. All our caudex plants have either recently sprouted or will sprout shortly after arrival (3-9 weeks). We have different size caudexes available and each caudex ships in a terracotta pot.\r\\n\r\\nStephania Erecta is a rare and collectable vining caudiciform plant. The bulb or caudex looks kind of like a potato. As a houseplant, we recommend planting about halfway into the soil and allowing the caudex to be on display.\r\\n\r\\nWhen planted, this rare plant will break dormancy and display a flush of parasol-shaped leaves along creeping vines. Allow the vines to cascade down, or train them up a trellis.\r\\n\r\\nYou?ll receive one dormant Stephania Erecta caudex, from 3 to 4? in diameter, PLUS a pretty planter pot made from natural, bio-degradable rice hulls and water-soluble binding agents. Each one is a bit different, so expect variation from the photos.\r\\n\r\\nWhen you receive your dormant caudex plant it in well-draining soil with the top half of the caudex exposed. The bottom of the caudex has an ?X? drawn on it. Water your Stephania Erecta when the soil is dry. This plant will not tolerate over-watering. Stephania Erecta wants bright, indirect light and good humidity. You can place an open plastic bag around the caudex to raise the humidity to encourage growth. Once you see growth, make sure not to place your plant in direct sunlight. This will burn the leaves and caudex.\r\\n<h4><strong>Care Tips and </strong><strong>Requirements</strong></h4>\r\\nNow that it?s sprouted, you?ll want to adjust your care routine.

Fertilize growing guavas every one to two months while young and then three to four times per year as the tree matures. Guava trees need a high amount of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, along with some magnesium for maximum fruit production. An example is a formula of 6-6-6-2, worked into soils just prior to the onset of the growing season and then evenly spaced out three times during the growth period. Water frequently after planting and then keep mature trees moderately moist during the blooming and fruiting seasons. Once established, caring for a guava fruit tree is similar to any fruiting tree care.\r\\n<h4><strong>Plant Maintenance</strong></h4>\r\\nThis fruit plant requires very little maintenance. Firstly, it should get sunlight for more than 6 hours a day. Secondly, water it when the soil seems dry. Prune the tree regularly and add fertilizer after each harvest. <a href=\"https://nurserynisarga.in/\">Nursery Nisarga</a> offers an Organic Potting mix that boosts the plant?s growth and makes it more resilient in fighting diseases.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '699', '799', 'Guava plant, Myrtaceae (Myrtle), Psidium guajava, Taiwan Pink Guava Plant', '', '', '', '', '', 'taiwan-pink-guava-plant', ''),

It features lovely glabrous red berries, a single-seeded drupe with a diameter of 5-8 mm, which has led to its widespread use as an ornamental plant in shaded areas.\r\\n<h4><span id=\"Ardisia_Overview\">Ardisia Overview</span></h4>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li><strong>Common Name- </strong>Ardisia, Christmas berry, coralberry, spice berry, marlberry.</li>\r\\n  <li><strong>Scientific Name- </strong>Ardisia crenata, Ardisia japonica, Ardisia solanacea, Ardisia elliptica, etc.</li>\r\\n  <li><strong>Family- </strong>Primulaceae.</li>\r\\n  <li><strong>Light- </strong>Bright, indirect light if grown indoors, partial shade outside.</li>\r\\n  <li><strong>Water- </strong>Keep evenly moist at all times, not too wet or dry.</li>\r\\n  <li><strong>Temperature- </strong>Optimal between 60-90 degrees, USDA zones 9-11 for most.</li>\r\\n  <li><strong>Humidity- </strong>Tolerant of humidity but might need less watering if very humid out.</li>\r\\n  <li><strong>Soil- </strong>Prefers well-drained soil, but is tolerant of many soil types.</li>\r\\n  <li><strong>Fertilizer- </strong>Balanced slow-release fertilizer monthly in spring & summer.</li>\r\\n  <li><strong>Pests- </strong>Leafcutter ants, birds, raccoons, mealybugs.</li>\r\\n  <li><strong>Diseases- </strong>Fungal root rot.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n<h4><span id=\"Ardisia_Overview\">About Ardisia Crenata</span></h4>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li><b>Flowering:</b> This plant produces small clusters of white or very pale pink flowers which bloom from late spring to early summer. Once the flowers have bloomed they\'re followed by clusters of red berries, which last for a fair few months. The flowers and berries appear within the midsection of the tree.</li>\r\\n  <li><b>Foliage:</b> As mentioned above the leaves grow on branches from a single stem usually, although multiple stem plants can also grow. The glossy dark green serrated leaves which are oval-shaped, grow to approximately 3 - 5 inches long and a couple of inches wide. Overall, the coralberry tree looks attractive with or without flowers and berries, especially if it\'s pruned well.</li>\r\\n  <li><b>Displaying:</b> The coral is a fine looking species which looks great in a prominent position that will be noticed by yourself and visitors. Obviously, the conditions (light, temperature etc.) need to be right. Also, great looking in a conservatory or hallway and grow well in greenhouses (although not seen much here).</li>\r\\n  <li><b>Pruning:</b> I would advise growers to prune the Ardisia Crenata during spring before the flowers begin budding. This will keep the tree at a reasonable size and allow the foliage to become a nice rounded full shape.</li>\r\\n</ul>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '1249', '1399', 'Ardisia, Christmas Berry, Coral Berry, Marlberry, Spice Berry', '', '', '', '', '', 'ardisia-crenata-christmas-berry', '');

Keep the soil evenly moist, but allow it to dry out between waterings. Keep Philodendrons slightly drier during the winter months, when the growth slows.</li>\r\\n  <li>Overwatering will cause the leaves to turn yellow. Underwatering will cause the leaves to turn brown and fall off.</li>\r\\n  <li>Feed your Philodendron in the spring and again in mid-summer with a liquid house plant fertilizer. The ideal growing temperature is between 75 and 85 degrees F. during the day and in the 60\'s at night. Philodendron Plants will survive for a short time in temperatures as low as 36 degrees F. Wash the leaves regularly to prevent the pores from becoming plugged with dust.</li>\r\\n  <li>Philodendrons will tolerate the level of humidity found in most homes, but high humidity promotes lush growth and shiny foliage, so it is a good idea to mist the plant regularly.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n</div>\r\\n</div>\r\\n</div>\r\\n</div>\r\\n</div>\r\\n</div>\r\\n</div>\r\\n</div>\r\\n</section>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '275', '399', 'Golden, Golden Plant, Lucky, moneyplant, Moss Stick, Philodendron Oxycardium, Philodendron Oxycardium Golden Plant', '', '', '', '', '', 'philodendron-oxycardium-green-plant', ''),

They rarely grow taller than 5-6 feet. The fruit is very unique and though it is commonly eaten fresh, it?s a bit difficult to enjoy that way. Inside the thick tough rind are a large number of little juice-filled ?berries? inside, each with a little seed inside. The juice will stain, so it can be a challenge to get the edible bits out of the fruit without making a mess. Pomegranate juice is currently very popular for its healthy qualities.\r\\n\r\\nThe juice is high in vitamin C, potassium and vitamin B5, as well as a number of antioxidants that have a long list of health benefits. If you eat the small seeds in each ?berry?, you will also get a dose of fibre.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Pomegranate Care</strong>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>If you want your pomegranate to grow in a tree form, you will need to prune the many suckers that sprout up from the base of the trunk. You?ll also want to prune any dead branches each spring to keep your tree healthy. Once you have created a tree form for your plant, it shouldn?t require too much more pruning.</li>\r\\n  <li>After about 3 years, you will start to see your tree developing fruits</li>\r\\n  <li>but it will probably drop most of them before they mature. This is normal for pomegranates, and you won?t start to get a real harvest until around 5 years of age.</li>\r\\n  <li>Pomegranates are quite drought-tolerant but during any extended dry periods, they should be given a deep watering at least every 3 weeks if necessary. Fertilizer is helpful for the first year or two but after that most trees will do fine without additional nutrients unless you happen to have particularly poor soil. A yearly feeding or even just a dressing of compost or aged manure is enough.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n<strong>Containers</strong>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Pomegranates work fine in large containers, though you should keep them well trimmed and pruned to a small size. A dwarf variety will thrive the best. When shopping for a dwarf tree, double-check that it will produce fruit. The shrubs have lovely flowers, and many dwarfs or potted trees are ornamental only.</li>\r\\n  <li>Container plants will need a bit more water than garden-planted ones, but pomegranates will do fine in dry soil so you shouldn?t need to water them too frequently.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n<h5>Soil selection for Pomegranate</h5>\r\\nThe pomegranate thrives on calcareous, alkaline soil and on deep, acidic loam and a wide range of soils in between these extremes. In northern India, it is spontaneous on rock-strewn gravel.\r\\n<ol>\r\\n  <li>Plant your pomegranate seedling in soil with a pH of between 5.5 to 7.0 and full sunlight to partial shade.</li>\r\\n  <li>Irrigate your pomegranate tree every seven to 10 days. Hold off on your regular irrigation schedule if Mother Nature is adequately irrigating your pomegranate trees. Check that the soil around your pomegranate is evenly moist during late summer to early fall to help prevent fruit splitting.</li>\r\\n  <li>According to the California Rare Fruit Growers, as the pomegranate tree matures, it?s best to switch from fertilizer to an annual soil amendment of compost or rotted manure.</li>\r\\n  <li>?Since new fruit production occurs at the tip, the California Rare Fruit Growers recommends shortening the shoots every year for the first three years to encourage new growth and create a strong, sturdy plant. After the first three years, the occasional removal of dead branches is the tree?s only pruning requirement.</li>\r\\n</ol>\r\\n<strong>Pests and Diseases</strong>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>There are not a huge number of potential insect pests for pomegranates and they are a very easy tree to grow. Aphids can be a problem, but regular sprays with soapy water can help wash them off and keep them away.</li>\r\\n  <li>The pomegranate butterfly is one insect specific to the pomegranate but it?s only common in some regions. The butterfly lays eggs in the flower buds, and the growing larvae will bore into the new fruit to feed. You?ll need to spray your trees once or even twice during the early spring. Once they have moved into the fruit, they are difficult to kill.</li>\r\\n  <li>Leaves may develop some spots from various kinds of blight, but none are usually serious with pomegranates. Cut off any infected branches as soon as you see leaf blotching, and you should be fine as long as it hasn?t spread through the entire tree.</li>\r\\n  <li>The tough outer rind generally protects the fruit, so birds and other larger pests are not usually a problem except occasionally when the fruit is very young.</li>\r\\n</ul>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '549', '750', 'Bonsai, fruit, ornamental pomegrante, pomegranate', '', '', '', '', '', 'ornamental-dwarf-pomegranate-miniature-anar', ''),

The rounder variety which I planted does not look like kiwifruit except for the color. Chiku is spelt differently in different countries, but retaining the same pronunciation. Other names for chiku are sawo (Indonesia), sapota (part of India), lamoot (Thailand, Laos and Cambodia), sapote, sapodilla, zapote, sapoti, nispero, dilly, naseberry, chico sapote, and many other names. In Malaysia, we called it chiku. Its scientific name is Manilkara zapota.\r\\n\r\\nThe Sapodilla (chiku) is native to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. It was first introduced to the Philippines by the Spaniards. Now the chiku is a common fruit in South East Asia, India and Pakistan.\r\\n<h3>Features of Plant</h3>\r\\nThe tree can grow to a height of 30 meters (100 feet) high. However, a grafted plant can be controlled to a low height. The tree is very hardy fruiting easily throughout the year, although the fruits take a long time to ripen. The flowers are minute and white in color.\r\\n\r\\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manilkara_zapota\">Sapodilla</a> , popularly known in India as Chiku. In India, it is cultivated for fruits that are liked all over the country. The fruit is a fleshy berry, variable in shape, size, and weight (75-150g). The skin is thin, rusty brown somewhat scurfy looking like Irish potato, and the pulp soft, melting, crumbling with a sandy or granular texture with 1-5 hard, black seeds.\r\\n\r\\nGet in touch with us for small quantities for your rear garden, kitchen garden, home garden or large quantities for farmland development, fruit orchards, fruit farms, real estate layouts or commercial cultivation.\r\\n<h3><strong>Health benefits of Chiku</strong></h3>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>As with most fruits, Chiku has lots of beneficial nutrients and minerals.</li>\r\\n  <li>Chiku has a special compound called tannin which has anti-bacterial, anti-parasitic, and anti-viral properties.</li>\r\\n  <li>It has large amounts of vitamin A, vitamin B, and vitamin C.

The genus includes both?herbaceous?plants and?shrubs?growing to 0.5?2?m (1.6?6.6?ft) tall. Their common names are?<b>shrub verbenas</b>?or?<b>lantanas</b>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"></sup>\r\\n\r\\nLantana\'s aromatic?flower?clusters (called?umbels) are a mix of red, orange, yellow, or blue and white?florets. Other colors exist as new varieties are being selected. The flowers typically change color as they mature, resulting in?inflorescences?that are two- or three-colored.\r\\n\r\\nThe growing and care of lantanas is easy. These verbena-like flowers have long since been admired for their extended bloom time.\r\\n\r\\nThere are several varieties available that offer a multitude of colours. Depending on the region and type grown, lantana plants can be treated as annuals or perennials. Grow lantana flowers in the garden or in containers. Trailing varieties can even be grown in hanging baskets. <a href=\"https://nurserynisarga.in/product/lantana-camara/\">Lantanas</a> also make a great choice for those wishing to attract butterflies and hummingbirds to the garden.\r\\n<h4><strong>How to Grow Lantana Flowers</strong></h4>\r\\nGrowing lantana in the garden is a great way to add colour and interest. Simply choose a sunny location and plant them in well-draining soil. Although these plants are tolerant of many soil conditions, lantana flowers prefer slightly acidic soil. Mulching with pine needles is an easy way to raise pH levels in areas with low acid.\r\\n\r\\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lantana\">Lantanas</a> are planted in spring once the threat of cold weather and frost have ceased. Keep in mind, however, that they prefer warm temperatures so new growth may be slow to appear. Once the temperatures warm up though, they will grow abundantly.\r\\n<h4><strong>Caring for Lantana Plants</strong></h4>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>While newly planted lantanas require frequent watering, once established, these plants require little maintenance and are even tolerant of somewhat dry conditions. In fact, a good soaking about once a week should keep them relatively happy.</li>\r\\n  <li>Although it isn?t required, lantana plants can be given a light dose of fertilizer each spring, but too much may inhibit their overall flowering.</li>\r\\n  <li>To encourage reblooming, cut the tips (deadhead) periodically. Overgrown plants can be given new life by cutting back a third of their growth. They will bounce back quickly. Regular pruning of the plant usually takes place in spring.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n<h4><strong>Common Problems with Growing Lantanas</strong></h4>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>While lantanas are not affected by too many problems, you may encounter them on occasion.</li>\r\\n  <li>Powdery mildew can become a problem if the plant is not given enough light. In addition, the plant may develop root rot if it is kept too wet.</li>\r\\n  <li>Sooty mould is a condition that causes black discolouration on the leaves and is most often attributed to insect pests, such as whiteflies.</li>\r\\n  <li>Other common pests that affect lantana plants include lace bugs, which cause the foliage to turn grey or brown and then drop off.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n ', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '499', '599', 'lanta, Lantana Camara', '', '', '', '', '', 'lantana-exotic-pink-plant', ''),

Flowers appear in clusters at the end of branches and have a very distinctive fragrance. Unlike some flowering trees which bloom for a few days or weeks, Plumeria frangipani flower for months. Frequently used as a specimen tree, it has a stunning impact when used alone or as part of a tropical garden design. They look great in big pots on balconies or in courtyards as well.</p>\r\\nPlumeria Frangipani is commonly known as temple tree, simple plumeria , red paucipan and red jasmine. The flowers of Champa <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumeria\">Plumeria</a> Pink are the symbol of natural beauty with their striking color and eminent fragrance. It is the most beloved garden plant all around the world growing in the tropical and sub-tropical climate.\r\\n\r\\nPlumeria Frangipani is well-known for its intensely fragrant, lovely, spiral-shaped, reddish blooms which appear at branch tips. The tree itself is rather unusual in appearance; deciduous leaves cluster only at the tips of the rough, blunt, sausage-like, thick, grey-green branches. Branches are upright and rather crowded on the trunk forming a vase or umbrella shape with age. They are relatively soft and brittle and can break but are usually strong unless they are mechanically hit or disturbed. The crown briefly loses its leaves during the winter, displaying coarse textured, stubby branches. A milky juice is released when the branches are injured or punctured.\r\\n<h3>Features of Plumeria Frangipani</h3>\r\\nThe plants have thick stems, and the leaves are leathery. It grows as a spreading tree to 7?8 m (23?26 ft) high and wide, and is flushed with <a href=\"https://nurserynisarga.in/?s=Frangipani&post_type=product&dgwt_wcas=1\">Frangipani</a> blood red flowers that become even more fragrant once picked. The 5-petalled flowers come in an array of colours. They require a minimum of 6 hours of full sunlight a day in order to reach its potential in growth and flower quality.\r\\n\r\\nIn cooler climates, plumeria are grown in containers, as they will not tolerate cold. In areas that may be warm most of the time but still fairly prone to cold winters, the plant can be dug up and overwintered indoors. Alternatively, you can sink container grown plumerias in the ground, bringing them indoors once the temperatures begin to drop in fall. Once warmer temps return in spring, you can return the plants back outdoors. When growing plumeria plants in pots, use a coarse, well-draining potting mix?cactus mix or perlite and sand should be fine.\r\\n<h3>Planting & Care</h3>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Light: Plumerias prefer bright sunlight</li>\r\\n  <li>Watering: Water your plumeria regularly so the soil never dries out completely.</li>\r\\n  <li>Humidity: Moderate humidity for optimum growth.</li>\r\\n  <li>Exposure: Require at least 6 to 7 hours of direct sun every day.</li>\r\\n  <li>Maintenance: Easy to care</li>\r\\n  <li>Soil: They grow well in light soils having good drainage.</li>\r\\n  <li>Fertilizing: In growing season, feed with phosphate fertilizer every two or three weeks to promote new growth.</li>\r\\n</ul>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '799', '999', 'champa, plumeria, Plumeria Red, Red Champa, Red Frangipani', '', '', '', '', '', 'plumeria-frangipani-blood-red-temple-tree', ''),

Orchids in this genus are?monopodial?<a title=\"Epiphyte\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphyte\">epiphytes</a>?or?<a title=\"Lithophyte\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithophyte\">lithophytes</a> with long, coarse roots, short, leafy stems, and long-lasting, flat flowers arranged in a flowering stem that often branches near the end. Orchids in this genus are native to India, Taiwan, China, Southeast Asia, New Guinea, and Australia with the majority in Indonesia and the Philippines.\r\\n\r\\nThe name ?orchid? comes from the Greek word?<em>orkhis,?</em>and was named by an ancient Greek botanist named Theophrastos, who thought the orchid\'s roots resembled a part of the male anatomy. Orchids are epiphytic in their native habitat, growing on trees and rock formations, instead of directly in the ground. These tropical orchids are known for their bright, showy flowers that come in many different colours.\r\\n\r\\nThe popular Phalaenopsis orchid is one of the easiest varieties of orchids to grow as a houseplant and is often called the beginner orchid due to its easygoing nature, or the moth orchid due to the shape of its blooms. this orchid with leafy stems and long-lasting flowers does best in a bright, warm, humid spot. Indoors, the Phalaenopsis will typically bloom about once a year, for up to three months. After a blooming cycle, the flowers will wilt and fall off. When this happens, don?t worry, your orchid is not dead, it?s just storing up energy to re-bloom again next season.\r\\n<h5>Sunlight</h5>\r\\nThrives in bright, indirect light, but can tolerate medium, indirect light.\r\\n<h5>Water</h5>\r\\nWater every 1-2 weeks, allowing the potting medium to dry out between waterings. If kept in a decorative cache planter, pour out excess water after watering. Expect to water more often in brighter light and less often in lower light.\r\\n<h5>Humidity</h5>\r\\nOrchids do not like dry air, so be sure to keep the humidity around the plant anywhere from 50?70%. During the fall or winter, you can help to boost humidity with a humidifier?or wet pebble tray.\r\\n<h5>Temperature</h5>\r\\nThe average home temperature of 65??75?F. They can tolerate as low as 55?F and as high as 85?F.\r\\n<h5>Potting Mix</h5>\r\\nSmaller orchids are potted in either a coco plug or sphagnum moss. They can remain in this potting medium for 1-2 years until their roots and leaves have outgrown the size of the pot and the orchid needs fresh nutrients and larger space. When repotting these orchids, you can pot them into bark media.\r\\n\r\\nLarger orchids are potted in a bark media. Bark provides the proper airflow required to keep mature roots happy and healthy. Because orchids are epiphytes that grow on trees in their natural habitat, they need air to flow around their roots, and traditional potting mix just won\'t do. (If you gently dig into the bark media with your fingers, you might just spot the coco plug at the center of the pot, where the baby orchid was first potted!.\r\\n<h5>Common Problems</h5>\r\\nSymptom: Wilting, wrinkling leaves\r\\nCause: Underwatered\r\\n\r\\nSymptom: Yellowing leaves\r\\nCause: Overwatered, or too much sun\r\\n\r\\nSymptom: Wilting flowers\r\\nCause: Ending its yearly blooming cycle, storing up energy to re-bloom', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '1095', 'moth orchid, phalaenopsis orchids', '', '', '', '', '', 'phalaenopsis-moth-orchid-plant', ''),

They perform best in full sun. This produces the most significant and biggest number of blossoms while preventing any foliar diseases. However, roses do well in part sun, particularly in warmer climates where sheltered afternoon sun keeps them cool during the heat of the day and also helps create the most intense fragrance.\r\\n\r\\nRoses require well-drained soil to thrive. Because some types rebloom and thrive, make sure to amend the soil with rich, well-aged compost and add fertilizer\r\\n\r\\nRoses benefit from regular pruning to keep them looking their best while encouraging healthy flowers. Prune in late winter, just before new growth emerges. A general rule is to prune back your rose back by about one-third of the total height to maintain its current size and shape.\r\\n\r\\nUneven soil moisture and drought encourage fungal diseases, so remove any dead or dying branches. Pruning also helps with air circulation around the plant, which can prevent powdery mildew and black spot fungus.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '549', '699', 'abracadabra, Floribunda garden rose, Gulab Plant, rosa, Rose', '', '', '', '', '', 'abracadabra-rose-plant-hocus-pocus-rose', ''),

That being said there are a few key things to keep in mind to ensure that you are maximizing the variegation on the leaves. While the pink princess produces flowers, the spathes are insignificant compared to the foliage of the plant and it is rare for them to flower indoors.</p>\r\\n\r\\n<h3 id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-12\" class=\"comp u-how-to-title-align mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading\"><span class=\"mntl-sc-block-subheading__text\">Light</span></h3>\r\\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-13\" class=\"comp text-passage u-how-to-title-align mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\">Providing your pink princess philodendron with enough light is the most important factor influencing the amount of variegation it will have. Choose a location that receives several hours of bright,?indirect light. When grown indoors, the pink princess philodendron can also tolerate a couple of hours of direct light, which may help to increase its variegation. If you do not have a location in your home that receives enough light, buying a grow light for this plant is recommended. Without enough light, the pink princess leaves will quickly begin reverting back to green and it will lose its stunning variegation.</p>\r\\n\r\\n<h3 id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-15\" class=\"comp u-how-to-title-align mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading\"><span class=\"mntl-sc-block-subheading__text\">Soil</span></h3>\r\\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-16\" class=\"comp text-passage u-how-to-title-align mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\">As an aroid, the pink princess philodendron enjoys airy, well-draining soil that is high in organic matter.

Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of a wide range of garden roses.\r\\n<h3>Rose Plant Care</h3>\r\\n<strong>Sunlight</strong>: The climbing rose loves full sunlight shade, and also protects it from the scorching afternoon sun.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Soil</strong>: Roses are grown in well-drained soil with optimum sunlight.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Water</strong>: Watering should be regular especially in the first year so that roots get established properly.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Fertilizer</strong>: During the active growth and blooming stage, rose plants need more fertilizing.\r\\n<h3>Growing Tips</h3>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>The very first aspect that should come to your mind at the time of planting a rose shrub is the kind of plant that must be planted in the soil. You can get different types of saplings like roses that are in the form of dormant bare root plants or as roses potted in the soil. If you are just starting with the task of rose planting you must start with container roses. It is very easy to plant them in the soil.</li>\r\\n  <li>You must bear in mind the fact that roses are a type of highly fragrant flowers which come in a large number of varieties. From climbing roses to the ground covers you can get roses in different colors, fragrances, and sizes. However, to begin with, you must not be too ambitious in your plans. If you think that growing a large variety of roses at a single time is a good idea then you must think again. Many of them are not compatible and can feed into each other\'s health, which can ruin your entire garden. Hence do not try to grow too many varieties at the same time.</li>\r\\n  <li>Roses grow best in a certain type of climate and environment. It is imperative that the <a href=\"https://nurserynisarga.in/?s=rose&post_type=product&dgwt_wcas=1\">rose</a> bushes must get sunlight for a continuous period of eight hours. Even then too harsh a sun can be bad for the flowers. In too severe winters try to plant your rose bushes so that they can be kept guarded against the winter\'s frosty hails. Additionally, try to plant roses in organically rich soil. It is best to plant roses in sandy soil that is well-drained.</li>\r\\n  <li>The timing of planning the bushes is also very important. Spring is the best period when you can plant roses. The first part of the fall is also a good time to plant roses. This is when the plant gets ample time to strike its roots deep before the arrival of the winter.</li>\r\\n  <li>You must water the rose beds regularly so that the harvest can be kept well-nourished.</li>\r\\n</ul>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '549', '799', 'creeper rose, pink rose, Rose', '', '', '', '', '', 'creeping-climbing-rose-plant-pink', ''),

When mature, the plant reaches about one to two feet in height.\r\\n<h4>Care for Alocasia Baginda Plant</h4>\r\\n<strong>Sunlight:</strong>\r\\n\r\\nAlocasias need bright, but indirect light. This is due to the plant\'s natural habitat, on the forest floor beneath the tree canopy. Direct sun will cause the leaves to burn, so avoid placing your Alocasia in a spot where it\'ll be exposed to the sun for a prolonged period. This plant is not tolerant of lower light conditions though, so make sure the space you\'re placing yours in feels very bright\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Water:</strong>\r\\n\r\\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alocasia\">Alocasia</a> prefers to sit in soil that is consistently and evenly moist. Allow the top 2-3\" to dry between watering to ensure the plant isn\'t sitting in soil that is too wet. During the winter, Alocasias will go through a dormancy period and will require less frequent watering as the soil will take longer to dry. Alocasias can be susceptible to root rot and fungal infections if their soil doesn\'t have proper drainage and becomes waterlogged, so we always advise potting these plants in a vessel with a drainage hole.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Fertilizer:</strong>\r\\n\r\\nDuring spring and summer, the <a href=\"https://nurserynisarga.in/?s=Alocasia&post_type=product&dgwt_wcas=1\">Alocasia</a> Siver Dragon will benefit from fertilizing once monthly. This plant isn?t a heavy feeder, so we recommend giving a diluted dose of any basic houseplant fertilizer (dilute or cut back to at least half the recommended amount). Again, too much isn?t a good thing and can cause other issues. want to stop supplementing with fertilizer as many houseplants, including the Siver Dragon, will enter a semi-dormant stage.\r\\n\r\\n<b><i>Repotting:</i></b>\r\\n\r\\nAlocasia Siver Dragon will benefit from repotting. Not only will this allow room for the roots to continually grow, but fresh soil can rejuvenate the plant. You?ll need well-draining soil that also allows for high aeration since these roots want to breathe. In addition, only go up in size by roughly 1-2 inches in diameter. Too much room at once isn?t favourable and does not support the plant?s ability to grow.\r\\n\r\\nPay attention to the condition of your Alocasia and its watering needs and you will have a long and happy relationship.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '549', '750', 'Alocasia, Alocasia Baginda, Alocasia Black Velvet Plant, Alocasia Reginula, Black Velvet Plant, Silver Dragon', '', '', '', '', '', 'alocasia-baginda-silver-dragon', '');

It\'s a flowering plant, producing deep red flowers, but not indoors though. Still, you can enjoy this plant solely for its foliage too.\r\\n\r\\n?Philo? means love, whereas ?Dendron? means ?tree?. The plant was named Philodendron in reference to the fact that it is a ?tree hugger? and loves to climb along with trees. It\'s very easy to grow beautiful plants with green, elliptical leaves that are thick and leather-like and arranged in an upright formation.\r\\n\r\\n<b>Philodendron?\'Red emerald\'?</b>is is an aggressive climber with long, narrow green leaves with <b>deep red veins and heart-shaped leaves</b>, The inflorescence consists of a foot-long purplish red spathe enclosing an upright spadix with many tiny petalless flowers.\r\\n<h4><b>Philodendron \'Red Emerald\' </b>Care</h4>\r\\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philodendron\">Philodendrons</a> grow best in medium light and bright indirect sunlight. Older leaves turn yellow naturally. However, several leaves turn yellow at once, which could be an indicator that the plant is getting too much sun. They will tolerate low light, but if the stems become leggy with several inches between the leaves, move the plant to a brighter location.\r\\n\r\\nPhilodendrons will produce larger leaves and remain healthier if you fertilize them regularly. Use slow-release pellets at the beginning of the growing season, or weekly 20-20-20 liquid fertilizer. During the winter you only need to fertilize about once per month.\r\\n<h4><strong>Size & Growth</strong></h4>\r\\nPhilodendron Burle Marx is a small-sized plant, and the maximum height it can usually reach is only two feet. Regarding the width, it grows between two and four feet.\r\\n<h4>Sunlight</h4>\r\\nBurle Marx likes bright places but he doesn?t like direct sunlight. It is best to place it near a window with bright-coloured curtains where the light will be bright but defused.\r\\n<h4><span id=\"Watering\"><strong><b>Watering</b></strong></span></h4>\r\\nWatering a Philodendron plant is much like watering most Philodendron plants. You want to keep the soil moist. You don?t want to drench the soil in water and you don?t want it to dry out. Over-watering your Philodendron is as dangerous as under-watering it.\r\\n<h4>Useful Tip</h4>\r\\nWhen you over-water, your plant is susceptible to different diseases. This includes the horrible root rot we discussed earlier. But root rot isn?t the only horrible condition your plant can go through. The other conditions are only a little better when it comes to planting damage. The only exception is during winter. When the cold months hit, you can let all the soil dry out before you water the Philodendron.\r\\n<h4><span id=\"Soil\"><strong><b>Soil</b></strong></span></h4>\r\\nThe best soil for Philodendron is 100% peat moss or a mix of 200% peat and perlite. For a plant, you need well-draining soil. This type of soil ensures excess water drains through the plant pot. This prevents all that extra water from building up in the soil.\r\\n<h4>Temperature</h4>\r\\nPhilodendron Burle Marx likes moderate room temperatures, from 60 to 75 degrees F.

It\'s very easy to grow beautiful plants with green, elliptical leaves that are thick and leather-like and arranged in an upright formation.\r\\n\r\\n<b>Philodendron?\'Red emerald\'?</b>is is an aggressive climber with long, narrow green leaves with <b>deep red veins and heart-shaped leaves</b>, The inflorescence consists of a foot-long purplish red spathe enclosing an upright spadix with many tiny petalless flowers.\r\\n<h4><b>Philodendron </b>Care</h4>\r\\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philodendron\">Philodendrons</a> grow best in medium light and bright indirect sunlight. Older leaves turn yellow naturally. However, several leaves turn yellow at once, which could be an indicator that the plant is getting too much sun. They will tolerate low light, but if the stems become leggy with several inches between the leaves, move the plant to a brighter location.\r\\n\r\\nPhilodendrons will produce larger leaves and remain healthier if you fertilize them regularly. Use slow-release pellets at the beginning of the growing season, or weekly 20-20-20 liquid fertilizer. During the winter you only need to fertilize about once per month.\r\\n<h4><strong>Size & Growth</strong></h4>\r\\nPhilodendron is a small-sized plant, and the maximum height it can usually reach is only two feet. Regarding the width, it grows between two and four feet.\r\\n<h4>Sunlight</h4>\r\\nIt likes bright places but he doesn?t like direct sunlight. It is best to place it near a window with bright-coloured curtains where the light will be bright but defused.\r\\n<h4><span id=\"Watering\"><strong><b>Watering</b></strong></span></h4>\r\\nWatering a Philodendron plant is much like watering most Philodendron plants. You want to keep the soil moist. You don?t want to drench the soil in water and you don?t want it to dry out. Over-watering your Philodendron is as dangerous as under-watering it.\r\\n<h4>Useful Tip</h4>\r\\nWhen you over-water, your plant is susceptible to different diseases. This includes the horrible root rot we discussed earlier. But root rot isn?t the only horrible condition your plant can go through. The other conditions are only a little better when it comes to planting damage. The only exception is during winter. When the cold months hit, you can let all the soil dry out before you water the Philodendron.\r\\n<h4><span id=\"Soil\"><strong><b>Soil</b></strong></span></h4>\r\\nThe best soil for Philodendron is 100% peat moss or a mix of 200% peat and perlite. For a plant, you need well-draining soil. This type of soil ensures excess water drains through the plant pot. This prevents all that extra water from building up in the soil.\r\\n<h4>Temperature</h4>\r\\nPhilodendron likes moderate room temperatures, from 60 to 75 degrees F. Still, they tolerate lower temperature conditions than most of the other houseplants.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '199', 'Philodendron, Ring of Fire Plant', '', '', '', '', '', 'philodendron-ring-of-fire-plant', ''),

The fruit, usually 4 to 12 cm long, are round or oval depending on the species. The outer skin may be rough, often with a bitter taste, or soft and sweet. Varying between species, the skin can be any thickness, is usually green before maturity, but becomes yellow, maroon, or green when ripe. Guava fruit generally has a pronounced and typical fragrance. Guava pulp may be sweet or sour, off-white to deep pink, with the seeds in the central pulp of variable number and hardness, again depending on species.\r\\n\r\\nThe strawberry guava is an attractive, carefree, drought-tolerant tree. It produces abundant amounts of fruit throughout the year. However, the fruit may be an acquired taste for some. When ripe, the Strawberry Guava fruit is maroon to dark red. The fruit size ranges from the size of a dime to about half the size of a golf ball. The flesh is yellowish-white with splashes of red-pink dotted with several hard yellow seeds. The skin is thin and easily bruised when the fruit is ripe.\r\\n\r\\nOverall the Strawberry Guava is a medium-sized tree or large bush with an average growth rate. The Strawberry Guava has multiple small-to-medium-sized almond-shaped leaves. The dense evergreen foliage makes this tree a great screen. However, it is also an attractive tree in its own right. The flowers are small white and relatively inconspicuous.\r\\n<h4>MAINTENANCE OF THE PLANTATION</h4>\r\\nOnce a plantation has been established, the work should not be considered finished. It will be necessary, for example, to protect the plantation against weather, fire, insects and fungi, and animals. A variety of cultural treatments also may be required to meet the purpose of the plantation. Guava plant needs full sun to part shade to grow, however, it cannot withstand too much heat. The guava plants have very little tolerance for cold. The plant is very frost tender and the matured tree will drop all the leaves in winter, while the young may die. The new leaves start to grow from the beginning of spring.\r\\n<h4>FERTILIZING</h4>\r\\nfertilizers in small quantities (generally below 100gm) after two to three months of planting with sufficient irrigation. Fertilize growing guavas every one to two months while young and then three to four times per year as the tree matures. Guava trees need a high amount of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, along with some magnesium for maximum fruit production. An example is a formula of 6-6-6-2, worked into soils just prior to the onset of the growing season and then evenly spaced out three times during the growth period. Water frequently after planting and then keep mature trees moderately moist during the blooming and fruiting seasons. Once established, caring for a guava fruit tree is similar to any fruiting tree care. Young trees benefit from fertilizer application with the type and amount varying with the area and soil type.\r\\n<h4>WATERING AND WEED CONTROL</h4>\r\\nGuavas prefer regular deep root watering, allow the soil to dry out somewhat between waterings. Provide regular water during the growing season, and reduce watering during the winter. Apply water at the base of the tree, avoiding its foliage from getting wet to prevent fungal disease. The older branches of the guava tree produce larger size guava fruit. So to promote branch growth, the tree must receive regular water. The guava tree is a heavy feeder, so it should be fertilized every 1-2 months when it is young; thereafter 3-4 times a year.\r\\n\r\\nGuava trees need a fertilizer high in nitrogen, phosphorus, potash, and some magnesium for maximum fruit production. Mix 6-6-6-2 fertilizer into soils beginning of the growing season and then 3-4 times during the growth period. Apply a fertilizer high in potassium to increase fruit production. I feed my guava plant with a liquid fertilizer throughout the growing season. Guava trees become iron deficient in alkaline and high pH soil. Fertilize 1-2 times with iron sulphate each year. Always water your guava plant after fertilizing to minimize the risk of burns.\r\\n<h4>PRUNING AND SHAPE OF GUAVA TREE</h4>\r\\nPrune the new plant at 1-2 feet length to produce new lateral branches. Allow such 3-4 branches to grow to 2-3 feet. Then cut the tips of these branches to grow more branches. Remove the weak branches. The tree in this way will become dense with a good canopy.\r\\n<h4>PEST & DISEASE FOR GUAVA TREE</h4>\r\\nEvery fruit tree has the future potential for disease and insect damage. Factors such as location and weather will play a part in which issues your tree encounters. If available, disease-resistant trees are the best option for easy care; and for all trees, proper maintenance (such as watering, fertilizing, pruning, spraying, weeding, and fall cleanup) can help keep most insects and diseases at bay.\r\\n<h4>HARVESTING YOUR GUAVA TREE</h4>\r\\nThe guava fruit matures in 2-4 months after the flowers bloom. The fruit remains hard and green but changes color and becomes softer when it is ripe. Fruits picked green will ripen when stored at room temperature. (Fruit Ripening with Ethylene).harvest when fully colored, and fragrant! or a bit earlier if you like them really tart. they are really nice if the fruit flies don?t trash them.\r\\n<h4>PLANTING INSTRUCTIONS</h4>\r\\n1. Prioritize your tree planting with the sun?s direction to maximize shade by planting on the southwestern and western sides of your home\r\\n2. Guava is very hardy. It can thrive on all types of soil from alluvial to lateric. However, it is sensitive to waterlogging. It can be grown on heavier but well-drained soil. Deep friable and well-drained soils are the best. The topsoil should be rich for a better stand. Soil pH range of 4.5 to 8.2 is congenial for guava but saline or alkaline soils are unsuitable.\r\\n3. For Commercial Plantation, the standard spacing for guava is, 6m x 6m, accommodating 112 plants /acre. However, it is commonly planted at a distance of 3.6 m to 5.4m (12? to 18?). Traditional planting spaces in some parts of the country range even up to 5.4 to 7.0m (18?o 23?). By increasing plant density, productivity can be increased. Although there would be a reduction in the size of fruits, the number of fruits per plant remains more or less similar.\r\\n4. In a home garden generally, we are planting one or two guava fruit along with other species of fruit plants. So it is better to keep a minimum 7-meter distance from other plants to plant a guava\r\\n5. 100% sunlight is best but can grow up to 50 % shade\r\\n6. During dry weather, initially water the plant once in two days, and after one month of planting water every 7 to 10 days during the first year.\r\\n7. Do not use chemical fertilizer or any other chemicals on your newly planted trees. Such products will kill your young trees. If needed you can add chemical fertilizers in small quantities (generally below 100gm) after two to three months of planting with sufficient irrigation.\r\\n8. Do not overwater or allow rainwater so much that you see standing water in the pit area of the plant.

They were originally found in Indonesia so they do well in the warm climates of our houses.? They are a fairly easy plant to grow indoors if you follow the care instructions listed below.\r\\n<h6><strong>Light and heat requirements</strong></h6>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Crotons need a very brightly lit location so that they keep their bright colours. They enjoy a western or southern window location. If they have plenty of light the leaves will have more variegation and the colours will be brighter.</li>\r\\n  <li>They need to be kept at a minimum temperature of 60?F during the night and around 70?F during the daytime. If they aren?t kept at this temperature they will begin to drop their leaves.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n<h6><strong>Water requirements</strong></h6>\r\\nCrotons need to have their soil evenly moist at all times, they tend to wilt easily if the soil is too dry. On the other hand, if the soil is too wet the leaves will turn brown on the edges. These plants also prefer to have a location with higher humidity. It is generally recommended that they be placed somewhere with a humidity of 40-80%. If the humidity isn?t high enough the plants will drop some of their leaves and the colour of the leaves may not be as vibrant.\r\\n<h6><strong>Common problems</strong></h6>\r\\nThe most common problem that people experience with crotons is spider mites. If the humidity is too low this tends to make them very susceptible to spider mites. The best way to get rid of the pests is to apply a miticide and mist them daily.\r\\n<h6><strong>Sunlight</strong></h6>\r\\nPlant crotons where they will receive direct sunlight for at least six to eight hours a day. They can grow as tall as 6 feet and up to 3 feet wide with enough light. Their green leaves turn to shades of yellow, red and purple throughout the year, showing their brightest colours in the sun in cooler months.\r\\n<h6><strong>Weather Conditions</strong></h6>\r\\n<a href=\"https://nurserynisarga.in/?s=croton&post_type=product&dgwt_wcas=1\">Crotons</a> are evergreen plants and will continue to grow throughout winter when they show off their colours. Crotons grow best at between 60 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Lower night or seasonal temperatures will not harm the plants, as they are hardy enough to withstand temperatures as low as 40 F. However, it is wise to cover a bed of crotons or bring potted ones indoors if a frost is expected. The plants can tolerate heat as high as 100 F but should have some shade in areas that experience severe heat.\r\\n<h6><strong>Water</strong></h6>\r\\nWell-drained soil works best for growing crotons outdoors so the soil can dry between waterings. Pots should provide good drainage, as well. Water the plants when the top of the soil is dry. On especially hot days, you may need to water the crotons twice a day. Crotons like humid weather, and misting the plants throughout the hottest days of summer will help the leaves stay bright and healthy.\r\\n<h6><strong>Fertilizer</strong></h6>\r\\nOutdoor crotons require fertilizer with a recommended ratio of 3-1-2 (3 per cent nitrogen, 1 per cent phosphorus and 2 per cent potassium). Liquid or gradual-release granular fertilizer work well, using amounts listed on the packaging. Too much fertilizer can damage the roots and cause the leaves to be dull instead of bright and shiny.\r\\n<h6><strong>Pests</strong></h6>\r\\nAlthough crotons are generally pest-free, they can be affected by a few garden pests. Mealybugs are a type of scale insect that show up as white cottony masses. Mites are eight-legged insects that cause the leaves to become curled or speckled. Thrips are commonly called \"greenhouse thrips,\" and often attack newly developed plants. They leave scarred or calloused spots where they feed. These pests can be treated with a pesticide developed for tropical plants or houseplants.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '199', 'croton, Variegated Croton, Variegated Tamara Croton', '', '', '', '', '', 'variegated-tamara-croton-plant', ''),

The plant is also characterized by its vigorous growth and healthy foliage.\r\\n<h4>Introduction</h4>\r\\nA rose is a woody perennial of the genus Rosa, within the family Rosaceae. There are over 100 species and thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing or trailing with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.\r\\n\r\\nFlowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colors ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwest Africa. Species, cultivars, and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.\r\\n\r\\nRose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of a wide range of garden roses.\r\\n<h3>Rose Plant Care Tips</h3>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>The very first aspect that should come to your mind at the time of planting a rose shrub is the kind of plant that must be planted in the soil. You can get different types of saplings like roses that are in the form of dormant bare root plants or as roses potted in the soil. If you are just starting with the task of rose planting you must start with container roses. It is very easy to plant them in the soil.</li>\r\\n  <li>You must bear in mind the fact that roses are a type of highly fragrant flowers which come in a large number of varieties. From climbing roses to the ground covers you can get roses in different colors, fragrances, and sizes. However, to begin with, you must not be too ambitious in your plans. If you think that growing a large variety of roses at a single time is a good idea then you must think again. Many of them are not compatible and can feed into each other\'s health, which can ruin your entire garden. Hence do not try to grow too many varieties at the same time.</li>\r\\n  <li>Roses grow best in a certain type of climate and environment. It is imperative that the rose bushes must get sunlight for a continuous period of eight hours. Even then too harsh a sun can be bad for the flowers. In too severe winters try to plant your rose bushes so that they can be kept guarded against the winter\'s frosty hails. Additionally, try to plant roses in organically rich soil. It is best to plant roses in sandy soil that is well-drained.</li>\r\\n  <li>The timing of planning the bushes is also very important. Spring is the best period when you can plant roses. The first part of the fall is also a good time to plant roses. This is when the plant gets ample time to strike its roots deep before the arrival of the winter.</li>\r\\n  <li>You must water the rose beds regularly so that the harvest can be kept well-nourished.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n<h4><strong>Uses</strong></h4>\r\\nRoses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging, and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization. They also have minor medicinal uses.', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '449', '699', 'Hansa Rose, Lavender Lassie Rose, Midnight Blue Rose, Purple Rose, Rose, Tradescant Rose', '', '', '', '', '', 'purple-rose-lavender-rose-plant', ''),

A small tree, the plumeria reaches heights of about 30 feet at maturity. Also known as frangipani, a plumeria is a warm-climate plant hardy suitable to the Indian climate. Although the plant won\'t tolerate freezing winter climates, it can be planted in a container and brought indoors when the weather turns cold. Plumeria grow profusely in Hawaii, and is a popular flower choice for leis.\r\\n<h5><strong>Planting and Caring</strong></h5>\r\\n<ul>\r\\n  <li>Purchase a healthy plumeria tree at a Nursery Nisarga. Select a compact plumeria plant with an even, bright color and a sturdy, straight trunk. Look for evenly-spaced branches. Avoid plants with wilted leaves or poor color.</li>\r\\n  <li>Position the plumeria where the tree will be exposed to bright sunlight for at least 4 to 6 hours every day. Choose a planting location where the soil drains well and water doesn\'t puddle after rainfall. Avoid locations where the plumeria will be exposed to heat radiating off a brick or concrete wall.</li>\r\\n  <li>Plant a plumeria in a sturdy container filled almost to the top with a good quality commercial cactus mix or all-purpose potting mix. Use a container at least 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 cm) in diameter. Be sure to use a container with a hole in the bottom to provide soil drainage, as a plumeria won\'t do well with wet feet.</li>\r\\n  <li>Water a plumeria deeply, then don\'t water it again until the soil is dry. Decrease watering when the weather cools in autumn and stop watering completely during the winter months. Resume normal watering when you can see new growth in spring.</li>\r\\n  <li>Feed a plumeria a high-nitrogen granular fertilizer with a ratio such as 32-6-2 every 2 to 3 weeks, beginning when new growth appears in spring. Change to a high phosphorus granular fertilizer with a ratio such as 10-50-10 in early May, and continue feeding the plant with the high phosphorus fertilizer every 2 to 3 weeks until August. Don\'t fertilize the plumeria after September 1.</li>\r\\n</ul>\r\\n<h3>Short Description</h3>\r\\n<table class=\"agnis_table_01\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\">\r\\n<tbody>\r\\n<tr>\r\\n<th>Plant Regional Name</th>\r\\n<td>White Plumeria Alba</td>\r\\n</tr>\r\\n<tr>\r\\n<th>Plant Common Name</th>\r\\n<td>White Plumeria, Champa White, Khairchapha</td>\r\\n</tr>\r\\n<tr>\r\\n<th>Category</th>\r\\n<td>Trees, Shrubs</td>\r\\n</tr>\r\\n<tr>\r\\n<th>Plant Sunlight Need</th>\r\\n<td>Sun Growing, Semi Shade</td>\r\\n</tr>\r\\n<tr>\r\\n<th>Plant Water Need</th>\r\\n<td>Normal, Can tolerate less, Can tolerate more</td>\r\\n</tr>\r\\n<tr>\r\\n<th>Plant Flowering Season</th>\r\\n<td>Year-around flowering, Flowers in flushes throughout the year</td>\r\\n</tr>\r\\n</tbody>\r\\n</table>\r\\n</div>', '', '', 0, 0, '', '', '[]', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 0, '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '599', '649', 'Champa White, Khairchapha, white champa, White Plumeria, white plumeria alba', '', '', '', '', '', 'white-champa-plumeria-alba-white', '');
